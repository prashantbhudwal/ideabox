Good writing is ‘[useful writing](http://www.paulgraham.com/useful.html)’. Useful writing is novel, correct, important, and strong.

Humans developed writing as a technology for transferring thoughts. A writer’s only purpose is to enable this transfer.

The clearer the thought, the easier its transfer becomes. [Clear thinkers](https://g.co/kgs/g1TCSM) are [clear writers](https://www.collaborativefund.com/blog/the-most-overlooked-trait-of-investing-success/). Achieve clarity by identifying [clear writing](http://www.tilsonfunds.com/motley_berkshire_warren_speeches.php) and imitating it. Imitate [entrepreneurs](https://venturehacks.com/writing), imitate [economists](https://www.realclearmarkets.com/articles/2019/08/28/how_the_aspiring_can_learn_to_write_like_economists_103883.html), imitate [investors](http://www.paulgraham.com/articles.html).

The smoother the transfer, the more permanent the thought becomes. Achieve permanence by [fascinating](https://g.co/kgs/suXjYA) the reader with [sticky](https://g.co/kgs/Fn7QKq) and [persuasive](https://g.co/kgs/ipjNGh) writing.

Don’t seek motivation to write. Write for yourself, be a [selfish writer](https://www.collaborativefund.com/blog/selfish-writing/). This means developing an [inner scorecard](https://fs.blog/2016/08/the-inner-scorecard/). Keep writing and the [score will take care of itself](https://g.co/kgs/3T8xr5).

## [How to become a better writer](https://dilbertblog.typepad.com/the_dilbert_blog/2007/06/the_day_you_bec.html)

Improve the [elements of your style](https://g.co/kgs/3NmfpT) and [grammar](https://g.co/kgs/3YwR76). First, learn ‘[How not to write](https://g.co/kgs/uNtDeX)’. Then, understand the principles of [writing well](https://g.co/kgs/6jYe5Z). Finally, act like a [professional](https://fs.blog/2017/08/amateurs-professionals/) in the [war of art](https://g.co/kgs/DmSmxs).

Rewrite, rewrite, rewrite. Read your writing, edit errors like a [copyeditor](https://g.co/kgs/5Re4Tz) and [rewrite](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/1025221-the-only-kind-of-writing-is-rewriting).

That is all there is to writing.
