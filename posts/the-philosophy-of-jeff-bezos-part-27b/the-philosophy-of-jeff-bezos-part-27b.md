This is the fifth of six posts in the series that maps out Jeff's philosophy in his own words. In short, this particular post is the thematic compilation of the most interesting ideas from the **shareholder letters written by Bezos from 2016 to 2020**. To understand more about the series and my reasons behind writing it, read the preface from **[Part 1 of this series.](https://ideabox.substack.com/p/the-philosophy-of-jeff-bezos-part)**

2016 - 2020

```

_Editor's Note: Letters from 2016, 17, 18 and 20 are incredibly dense. Before 2016, the updates to philosophy ratio for each letter was around 70:30. This flips around in the years that follow. Other than the 2019 letter - which is mostly about COVID-19 - the rest of the letters are packed with Jeff's thoughts, advice and methods. I will try my best to find out the best bits from these letters, but be warned - I will deliberately leave out a lot. [This series is a map](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Map%E2%80%93territory_relation), and therefore its usefulness lies in deliberately leaving out some information and abstracting some other._

On Strategy for Day 2
---------------------

“Jeff, what does Day 2 look like? ...“Day 2 is stasis. Followed by irrelevance. Followed by excruciating, painful decline. Followed by death. And _that_ is why it is _always_ Day 1.”...I’m interested in the question “How do you fend off Day 2?” What are the techniques and tactics? How do you keep the vitality of Day 1, even inside a large organization? ...Here’s a starter pack of essentials for Day 1 defense: customer obsession, a skeptical view of proxies, the eager adoption of external trends, and high-velocity decision making....2016

There are many ways to center a business. You can be competitor focused, you can be product focused, you can be technology focused, you can be business model focused, and there are more. But in my view, obsessive customer focus is by far the most protective of Day 1 vitality...Staying in Day 1 requires you to experiment patiently, accept failures, plant seeds, protect saplings, and double down when you see customer delight. A customer-obsessed culture best creates the conditions where all of that can happen...2016

As companies get larger and more complex, there’s a tendency to manage to proxies...A common example is process as proxy. Good process serves you so you can serve customers. But if you’re not watchful, the process can become the thing...The process becomes the proxy for the result you want. You stop looking at outcomes and just make sure you’re doing the process right. Gulp. It’s not that rare to hear a junior leader defend a bad outcome with something like, “Well, we followed the process.” ... The process is not the thing...2016

The outside world can push you into Day 2 if you won’t or can’t embrace powerful trends quickly. If you fight them, you’re probably fighting the future. Embrace them and you have a tailwind...2016

So, have you settled only for decision quality, or are you mindful of decision velocity too? Are the world’s trends tailwinds for you? Are you falling prey to proxies, or do they serve you? And most important of all, are you delighting customers?...2016

**On Invention**
----------------

Good inventors and designers _deeply_ understand their customer. They spend tremendous energy developing that intuition. They study and understand many anecdotes rather than only the averages you’ll find on surveys. They _live_ with the design.

I’m not against beta testing or surveys. But you, the product or service owner, must understand the customer, have a vision, and love the offering. Then, beta testing and research can help you find your blind spots. A remarkable customer experience starts with heart, intuition, curiosity, play, guts, taste. You won’t find any of it in a survey...2016

On Decision Making
------------------

_Editor's Note: Here are the ideas to help you make high-velocity decisions._

First, never use a one-size-fits-all decision-making process. Many decisions are reversible, two-way doors. Those decisions can use a light-weight process. For those, so what if you’re wrong? I wrote about this in more detail in last year’s letter...2016

Second, most decisions should probably be made with somewhere around 70 percent of the information you wish you had. If you wait for 90 percent, in most cases, you’re probably being slow...2016

Third, use the phrase “disagree and commit.” This phrase will save a lot of time....I disagree and commit all the time. We recently greenlit a particular Amazon Studios original. I told the team my view: debatable whether it would be interesting enough, complicated to produce, the business terms aren’t that good, and we have lots of other opportunities. They had a completely different opinion and wanted to go ahead. I wrote back right away with “I disagree and commit and hope it becomes the most watched thing we’ve ever made.” Consider how much slower this decision cycle would have been if the team had actually had to _convince_ me rather than simply get my commitment...2016

Fourth, recognize true _misalignment_ issues early and escalate them _immediately_. Sometimes teams have different objectives and fundamentally different views. They are not aligned. No amount of discussion, no number of meetings will resolve that deep misalignment. Without escalation, the default dispute resolution mechanism for this scenario is exhaustion. Whoever has more stamina carries the decision...2016

On Building a Culture of High Standards
---------------------------------------

_Editor's Note: The 2017 letter is an essay on building a culture of high standards. Taking out excerpts from this letter and categorising them was impossible. So, I wrote a post that could stand independently. It is a shortened and annotated version of the letter. Here is a link to it._

On Hiring
---------

From very early on in Amazon’s life, we knew we wanted to create a culture of builders—people who are curious, explorers.

-   They like to invent.
    
-   Even when they’re experts, they are “fresh” with a beginner’s mind.
    
-   A builder’s mentality helps us approach big, hard-to-solve opportunities with a humble conviction that success can come through iteration: invent, launch, reinvent, relaunch, start over, rinse, repeat, again and again.
    
-   They know the path to success is anything but straight...2018
    

_Editor's Note: At this point, it would be helpful to do a google search for 'non-linearity', 'design thinking', and 'power laws'._

On Invention
------------

Sometimes (often actually) in business, you do know where you’re going, and when you do, you can be efficient. Put in place a plan and execute...Wandering is an essential counterbalance to efficiency. You need to employ both. The outsized discoveries—the “nonlinear” ones—are highly likely to require wandering...2018

The biggest needle movers will be things that customers don’t know to ask for. We must invent on their behalf. We have to tap into our own inner imagination about what’s possible...No one asked for AWS. No one...No customer was asking for Echo... If you had gone to a customer in 2013 and said “Would you like a black, always-on cylinder in your kitchen about the size of a Pringles can that you can talk to and ask questions, that also turns on your lights and plays music?” I guarantee you they’d have looked at you strangely and said, “No, thank you.”...2018

As a company grows, everything needs to scale, including the size of your failed experiments. If the size of your failures isn’t growing, you’re not going to be inventing at a size that can actually move the needle...a single big winning bet can more than cover the cost of many losers...2018

On Covid & 19
-------------

_Editor's Note: The 2019 letter is 80 per cent Covid, and 20 per cent company updates. There is no direct active philosophizing. So, I have decided to skip the letter. If you are interested, [here is the link to the letter](https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/company-news/2019-letter-to-shareholders#:~:text=To%20our%20shareowners%3A,customers%20through%20this%20difficult%20time.)._

On Success
----------

If you want to be successful in business (in life, actually), you have to create more than you consume. Your goal should be to create value for everyone you interact with...2020

Jeff's Final Word
-----------------

_Editor's Note: On July 5, 2021, Jeff stepped down as Amazon's CEO. The same day on which he incorporated Amazon exactly 27 years ago. So, the 2020 letter was Jeff's final letter. Here is the best part of that letter in full._

### **Differentiation is Survival and the Universe Wants You to be Typical**

This is my last annual shareholder letter as the CEO of Amazon, and I have one last thing of utmost importance I feel compelled to teach. I hope all Amazonians take it to heart.

Here is a passage from Richard Dawkins’ (extraordinary) book The Blind Watchmaker. It’s about a basic fact of biology.

_“Staving off death is a thing that you have to work at. Left to itself – and that is what it is when it dies – the body tends to revert to a state of equilibrium with its environment. If you measure some quantity such as the temperature, the acidity, the water content or the electrical potential in a living body, you will typically find that it is markedly different from the corresponding measure in the surroundings. Our bodies, for instance, are usually hotter than our surroundings, and in cold climates they have to work hard to maintain the differential. When we die the work stops, the temperature differential starts to disappear, and we end up the same temperature as our surroundings. Not all animals work so hard to avoid coming into equilibrium with their surrounding temperature, but all animals do some comparable work. For instance, in a dry country, animals and plants work to maintain the fluid content of their cells, work against a natural tendency for water to flow from them into the dry outside world. If they fail they die. More generally, if living things didn’t work actively to prevent it, they would eventually merge into their surroundings, and cease to exist as autonomous beings. That is what happens when they die.”_

While the passage is not intended as a metaphor, it’s nevertheless a fantastic one, and very relevant to Amazon. I would argue that it’s relevant to all companies and all institutions and to each of our individual lives too. In what ways does the world pull at you in an attempt to make you normal? How much work does it take to maintain your distinctiveness? To keep alive the thing or things that make you special?

I know a happily married couple who have a running joke in their relationship. Not infrequently, the husband looks at the wife with faux distress and says to her, “Can’t you just be normal?” They both smile and laugh, and of course the deep truth is that her distinctiveness is something he loves about her. But, at the same time, it’s also true that things would often be easier – take less energy – if we were a little more normal.

This phenomenon happens at all scale levels. Democracies are not normal. Tyranny is the historical norm. If we stopped doing all of the continuous hard work that is needed to maintain our distinctiveness in that regard, we would quickly come into equilibrium with tyranny.

We all know that distinctiveness – originality – is valuable. We are all taught to “be yourself.” What I’m really asking you to do is to embrace and be realistic about how much energy it takes to maintain that distinctiveness. The world wants you to be typical – in a thousand ways, it pulls at you. Don’t let it happen.

You have to pay a price for your distinctiveness, and it’s worth it. The fairy tale version of “be yourself” is that all the pain stops as soon as you allow your distinctiveness to shine. That version is misleading. Being yourself is worth it, but don’t expect it to be easy or free. You’ll have to put energy into it continuously.

The world will always try to make Amazon more typical – to bring us into equilibrium with our environment. It will take continuous effort, but we can and must be better than that.

**Epilogue:**
-------------

> Hofstadter's Law: It always takes longer than you expect, even when you take into account Hofstadter's Law.

Humans, while providing estimates, are limited by Hofstadter's Law - It always takes longer than you expect, even when you take into account [Hofstadter's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hofstadter%27s_law). Simply stated - **to err in estimation is human.**

In the first post of this series, I designed a game to trick myself into productivity - reading and synthesizing all of the Amazon shareholder letters in a week. I too, fell victim to Hofstader's Law. One week was a conservative estimate on my end and yet I have already taken triple the time. But I think that the game did what it was supposed to do. I managed to read all the letters in about two weeks and compile them in three. I am glad about that.

### **Mutually Exclusive & Collectively Exhaustive**

All that is left is creating a concise mega-post about the philosophy of Amazon, with categories and letter excerpts that are mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive. That is, I have to make the categories consistent and remove redundancies of thoughts from the excerpts. I will do that in the next post and that will mark the end of this series. I will try to do that within a couple of weeks. As I write this I can feel Hofstader's Law smirking at me. **But, to be optimistic is human too**.

Beyond the series, there are at least two spinoff posts that I plan to write in the near future based on this series. In the first one, I will explain the economics of Amazon. In the second, I will try to synthesise the Amazon philosophy in less than 200 words. So, watch out for those too.
