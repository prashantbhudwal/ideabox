<!-- Thought process behind tools -->

# Tools

Definition: A tool is any tangible or intangible resource—be it a physical implement, a conceptual method, or a collaborative asset—that augments abilities, whether of individuals or groups, to perform tasks, modify their environment, and achieve goals, regardless of its originally intended purpose.

In the tools section of this website I will share tools, mostly intangible, sometimes physical. An intangible tool could be an analytical method like "the scientific method", and algorithm like "depth first search", a software, a framework, etc.
