"The Great Depression: A Diary" and "Berlin Diary" are two of my favourite books. They are simple diaries written during extraordinary times. The former, as is clear from the name, was written during the Great Depression of 1929–35, and the latter during the Second World War. I like how even the most ordinary of information from extraordinary times becomes extraordinary in retrospect. I intend to replicate these books in spirit.

I believe we are currently living in an extraordinary time. There is no war, there is no depression (yet), but what has happened in AI in the last two years has been a sight to see. Which side am I on? I honestly don't know – I am not a maximalist, and neither am I a doomer. I think I am an observer at the frontlines and I think something magical is happening – whether it is positive or negative; time will tell, and I intend to document the journey. 

What can you expect? Essentially unedited thoughts, predictions, and expectations about AI. All stylistic errors, bad paragraphs, and ambiguous sentences will stay as they are, forever. Think of it as reading a first draft that will never be revised, except for typos and possibly footnotes for factual errors. I will not change "the core" of anything I write in retrospect. To ensure this, everything will be version controlled using git – anyone will be able to see all the edits.
