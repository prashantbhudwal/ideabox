### **Verse 1 (J. Cole)**

Listen up y'all, let me take you back in time

Before hooks, our React code was outta line

Components had state and lifecycle methods to bind

Ain't no reusability, it was a real grind

### **Verse 2 (Run the Jewels)**

We had to write the same code over and over again

Duplicating logic, it was such a pain

Refactoring was a nightmare, it caused us a strain

But then came useEffect, it was like a sweet rain

### **Hook**

UseEffect, useEffect, it changed the game

Now our code is DRY, it's never the same

Side effects, state changes, all in one frame

UseEffect, useEffect, it's never the same

### **Verse 3 (J. Cole)**

With useEffect, our components are now so clean

No more mess, it's like a brand new scene

We can handle async and sync, it's like a dream

Our code is so tight, it's like a perfect seam

### **Verse 4 (Run the Jewels)**

It's like we've been reborn, we can finally relax

No more spaghetti code, it's like a new syntax

UseEffect's our savior, it's got our back

It's like a fresh breeze, it's like a new track

### **Hook**

UseEffect, useEffect, it changed the game

Now our code is DRY, it's never the same

Side effects, state changes, all in one frame

UseEffect, useEffect, it's never the same

### **Outro (J. Cole and Run the Jewels)**

So if you're still stuck in the past

Come on over, join us, it's a blast

With useEffect, our code is so fast

It's like a new world, it's a contrast.

_**\-Yours Truly, GPT**_

Prompt

`Write a rap about useEffect hook in react. Make it in the style of jcole featuring run the jewels. Write it in such a way that it is historical and shows the transition from the world before hooks to the world after hooks. Also, make sure that you write it in such a way that only programmers can understand it, ie, the audience of the rap are senior programmers. Also, the poem has long sentences and multi syllable rhymes, not necessarily end rhymes. Use metaphors, alliterations, anaphora and other rhetorical devices. The pattern is verse, verse, hook..verse, verse, hook, ending with an outro.`
