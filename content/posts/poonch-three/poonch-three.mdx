The shell did not kill me. The metal fragments pierced through 2 inch thick sheet of steel, and slashed my organs. My shoulder had fallen off. I was not in pain. I was dead. My child was safe.

I am in pain now. My son saw me lying there, mutilated, drenched, lifeless. He had to pull my body out. He shouldn't have seen me like that. That, I can't forget. I saw my family cremate me. While they screamed as my body burnt, I was scared, the shells were still hitting my city. They shouldn't die before my eyes. They have suffered enough. I have seen enough.

At dawn, when my pyre was cold, I saw them collecting my ashes. My brother splashed water to settle my ashes, kneeled down to collect my charred bones and found three large fragments from the shell. I am in so much pain now.

For ten days, I was looking over my family. They are better now. So, today I took a trip down our market. I saw my friends when I walked by my shop. I was happy to see them. Their shops, like mine are completely destroyed. Some have opened up after the ceasefire. Many people haven't come back yet. They are still in Jammu.

I would have gone too if I had the chance. I died at around 8 am. The shelling stopped at 11. I wish I had the chance. I wish someone had told us the night before or that morning. We were living our lives. Why didn't they tell us?

I had seen shelling when I was young. It usually started at the border and took a few days to reach the city. By then, we were prepared. We were at our houses, in our basements. I too, have a basement. I know what to do. I could have saved my myself, my friends.

Why didn't they tell us? You see, next night while I was still burning, they bombed our Poonch even worse, but no one in the city died. A warning over a loud-speaker, a single siren wail, or just a WhatsApp message. They should have done something so I could do something. I am sorry, I know I am here to tell you what happened, but the pain it too much. These questions keep haunting me. I could have seen my children grow up.

I heard someone say they were proud they did not leave. They made fun of people who left; called them names. I don't understand it. I did not go and then my son had to pull my body out. How is that better than going away? Two children died right before their mother's eyes. Their father is in the ICU and still does not know about their children. How is that better than going away? I see children get scared when they mistake thunder for a shell. The pain is not just physical. These children survived, their parents survived, everyone they know survived, and yet they can't sleep at night. They will never be the same. How is that better than going away? I am telling you I would have gone if I had the chance. I did not. I could not.

Look at this now, this is my friend's cafe. There's nothing left. He just renovated and installed a new machines, ovens, now there's just ash. I heard him say that the Government is paying the families of deceased Rs 10 Lakh in compensation but there is no plan to give him anything. He just lost his livelihood, not his life.

We work 12 hours at our store, and barely save enough to put our children through school and pay for medical expenses once in a while. I have lost my shop. He has lost his shop. What do we do now? How would my wife raise our children without a shop to run? Is 10 Lakh enough? Is not supporting my friend who lost his shop, right?

They keep visiting my house. The ministers, politicians, policemen, administrators. They keep asking my family questions."When did it happen? Where was he standing? What was he doing?" How many times to do I have to watch my wife break into tears as she answers? I don't want my family to relive this. I don't want to relive this. I want the world to know. But I don't want my son to always be in pain because of my memory.

He is putting on a brave face now and I am proud of him. But he is just a child. They should stop asking. It is enough now. Let him be a child. Please let him forget what remained of me. Please let him remember me.
