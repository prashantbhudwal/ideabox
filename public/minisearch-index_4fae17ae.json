This book, although not scientific, is helpful. That is, if you follow the advice in the book, then you can expect above-average results. It is straightforward, easy to read, and offers practical advice. No wonder, it is highly recommended by many-many really smart people. But, there is a problem.\n\nDale through this book set the foundations for the modern self-help genre. The book follows a structure of sections divided into chapters, with each chapter based on a principle. In each chapter, there are several examples and logical arguments that support the principle with the goal to persuade the reader. Almost all self-help books follow a similar structure.\n\n![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fefeab831-fea6-4a16-97a2-c81677bfabcd_772x654.png)\n\n**The problem is this - most authors, including Dale, cherry-pick examples to prove a point without giving a complete picture.**\n\nLet me explain.\n\nIn section three, there is a chapter on getting cooperation from others.\n\n- **Chapter Name:** How to Get Cooperation. \n- **Principle:** Let the other person feel that the idea is his or hers.\n\nThe point that Dale wants to make in this chapter is \"No one likes to feel that he or she is being sold something or told to do a thing. We much prefer to feel that we are buying of our own accord or acting on our own ideas. We like to be consulted about our wishes, our wants, our thoughts.\"\n\nHe uses many examples in the chapter to prove his point. Most of them focused on selling things. But the one I found most fascinating was this particular quote that Dale used as a supporting example.\n\n- **Supporting Example:** Ralph Waldo Emerson in his essay “Self-Reliance” stated: “In every work of genius we recognize our own rejected thoughts; they come back to us with a certain alienated majesty.”\n\nI had heard about this essay by Emerson and always wanted to read it. So, I took a detour and started reading 'Self-Reliance'. The essay was fascinating. I highly recommend that you read it. It is an essay from the self-help genre before self-help was a thing. Written in the 1800s, it is bold and as relevant today as it was 200 years ago.\n\n![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F755aac7b-7008-4540-ad28-7caefd9eecca_333x499.jpeg)\n\nBut that was not what fascinated me most about it. The most fascinating thing, to me, was that the whole essay is based on the concept of individualism and most of the advice in the essay is completely opposite to what Dale offers in his book. Dale's book is about social intelligence while Emerson does not care about what people think. Here are some examples.\n\n- _\"He would utter opinions on all passing affairs, which being seen to be not private but necessary, would sink like darts into the ear of men and put them in fear.\"_\n- _\"Society is a joint-stock company, in which the members agree, for the better securing of his bread to each shareholder, to surrender the liberty and culture of the eater.\"_\n- _\"What I must do is all that concerns me, not what the people think.\"_\n\nThink of it like this - If Emerson read 'How to win friends and influence people', he would start fuming and call all the advice in the book bullshit. According to him, one should not care about winning friends and influencing people. But, Dale, treading carefully, the line between true and false, gives an impression that Emerson, an authority, supports what Dale proposes. But Emerson does not, he abhors what Dale proposes.\n\nThis is the problem with most self-help books. When authors use examples without giving the complete picture, it misleads the reader into believing things that are not true. Even worse are instances when readers are tricked into believing that they know more about a topic or a person than they actually do.\n\nShould you read Dale? Yes. Should you read Emerson? Yes. Is Dale right? I don't know. Is Emerson right? I don't know. Should you believe them and their ideas completely, before getting the complete picture? No.\n","id":"dfff66cc-3e2b-45cf-83b9-2ab7235fe878"},"2":{"slug":"a-rough-history-of-education-in-india","title":"A Rough History of Education in India.","shortTitle":"A Rough History of Education in India.","description":"","tags":"","heroImage":"","createdAt":"2021-02-20","content":"_\\-- Bro 1 and Bro 2 are British Bros who have just started ruling India. --_\n\n**Bro 1:** Hey bro, let's rule these people. \n\n**Bro 2:** Okay bro, but how? \n\n**Bro 1:** It's simple bro, let's create a course on ‘how to be ruled’ and call it education.\n\n**Bro 2:** Cool bro!!\n\n_\\- People come from England, and they implement a system of education. Soon after - a generation or two, or maybe more, I mean - a revolt happens. The one with Aamir Khan, I mean Mangal Pandey. There are hints of revolution. The Bros are worried.--_\n\n**Bro 1:** Hey bro, those other bros we called ‘to train the ruled’ kind of messed up. They taught them too much. Now, these people know too much about the west and the revolution. Remember what happened with the Americans, don’t you? They kicked us out. So, let's scale back. \n\n**Bro 2:** But how? Won't people revolt even more if we scale back?\n\n**Bro 1:** Nah bro. We'll tell them that we are Indianising education. Taking away our western education and focusing more on practical, real-world skills and focusing less on academic studies.\n\n**Bro 2:** But how will that help?\n\n**Bro 1:** No academic studies → no western thought → no thought of revolution. Problem solved. And they think we are helping them by teaching them practical stuff. Hah. We will have 99 problems but the revolution won't be one!\n\n**Bro 2:** Damn bro, this is some high-level ninja stuff.\n\n_\\-- It’s the late 1800s, Hunter commission sits down and makes education more practical and more Indian. A few acts follow it and the mission is accomplished. --_\n\n**Bro 1:** Bro, we are getting weaker in India and we might have to leave soon. \n\n**Bro 2:** Yeah bro, the world wars, the economic depression, and Mr. Gandhi are giving us a lot of headaches. Let's keep education on the backburner for a while. \n\n**Bro 1:** Cool bro. Let the Indians deal with it. \n\n_\\-- People in the Indian freedom movement start talking about education.--_\n\n**Bhai 1:** Bhai, we need to Indianise education. These people are killing our culture. \n\n**Bhai 2:** Yes Bhai. Let's sit down and talk. We will make education great again. \n\n_\\-- Many conferences happen for discussing the future of education in the decades before the Britishers left in 1947. --_\n\n**Bro 1 & Bro 2:** Bye India. We are gone now. \n\n**Bhai 1:** Bhai, we have to start the implementation now. Let's make education Indian again!!\n\n**Bhai 2:** But Bhai, all the systems were set up by the Bros and all of them work based on their education - IAS, IPS, bureaucracies, universities, etc. Can't we wait? \n\n**Bhai 1:** I don't know.\n\n**Bhai 2:** Also, there is a lot of instability in the country. People are killing each other Bhai.\n\n**Bhai 1:** Okay! Okay! I get it. Let's wait. And yes, change the meaning of ‘I’ in IPS and IAS from Imperial to Indian. That should work for now.\n\n**Bhai 2:** Great Idea. Will do.\n\n_\\-- The wait continues, commission after commission sits down to talk about education with the hope of making education great, practical, and Indian again. --_ \n\n**Bhai 2:** Bhai we need to do something, it's been almost 20 years since independence. \n\n**Bhai 1:** Yes. Idea! Let's make a salad of all the suggestions those smart people in those commissions gave us and call it a National Policy for Education.\n\n**Bhai 2:** That sounds slick and smart. I will take care of it. We will make education great, practical, and Indian again. \n\n_\\--- The National Education Policy of 1968 happened but the Indian system - education and economic - still couldn't sustain itself. --_\n\n**Bhai 2:** Now what? That didn't work as we planned. \n\n**Bhai 1:** Don't worry. It's already been 20 more years. We can do better than last time. We will make 'The NEW Education Policy' and that will make Indian education great, practical, and Indian again. \n\n**Bhai 2:** Another one? \n\n**Bhai 1:** Just wait and watch. \n\n_\\--- The New Education Policy of 1986. The political climate worsened in the country. Power changed hands. ---_\n\n**New Bhai 1:** Bhai, this policy by the other government is not great enough. Let's make it great again. Let's make it Indian again. Let's make the NEW Education policy NEW again.\n\n**New Bhai 2:** Yes!! \n\n_\\--- 1986 - early 1990s. More commissions. More recommendations. More reports. But before the New Policy could be made NEW again, power changed hands again.---_\n\n**Bhai 1:** We are back Bhai!!\n\n**Bhai 2:** Yes!! But what to do with these NEW reports, the ones other bhais made, about OUR new policy?\n\n**Bhai 1:** Nothing. We do nothing. We will make Education great again, as we promised in the New Policy. But since it is old now, we will ask more people to sit and ReNEW the NEW policy by discarding the NEW recommendations of the other bhais and asking our bhais to come up with NEW recommendations. \n\nNew Policy - (New ‘Other Bhai’ Rec) + (New ‘Our Bhai’ Rec) = New New Policy \n\n**Bhai 2:** What? Won't the people be confused about Renewing the policy which was New in the first place?\n\n**Bhai 1:** Don't worry. We will call it by a different name. \n\n_\\-- The Revised Program of Action 1992 for the New education policy comes into existence soon after the economic liberalization of India happens. That is, India moves towards capitalism. A lot of companies come to India in search of cheap labor and in the process the IT and other sectors boom. India's boom starts.--_\n\n**Bhai 2:** Bhai these companies are coming into India and it is great. A lot of people are getting employed and our education system is also great. \n\n**Bhai 1:** Yes!! See, I told you so. \n\n**Bhai 2:** You did? (waits for a response and then changes the topic) Anyways… But what about those people whom we made Indian again by teaching them in regional languages? These companies need people who speak English. They won't hire people educated in regional languages.\n\n**Bhai 1:** Don't worry. Someday, someone will figure something out. \n\n_\\-- NEP 2020. We will make education great, Indian and practical again. --_\n\n```\nDisclaimer: It's a crude simplification of things that happened, take it with a grain of salt.

To us, a martial artist looks more like this.\n\n![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0585b6e7-0a16-412b-8165-65a8904e39f2_960x640.jpeg)\n\nBut we also know they can look like this.\n\n![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbe48b3f1-4e79-4521-924a-ac1dfcfd9ece_594x381.jpeg)\n\nOr this.\n\n![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F12f5fab4-2046-48ff-8cd1-32f062046710_610x446.jpeg)\n\nAfter watching MMA for a while, you understand that it does not matter how the artists look or talk, mystery or no mystery, as long as they can fight and win. Their domain of expertise is fighting and that is what should decide how good or bad they are. There are a lot of fighters who look great, talk mystically, dress like a monk and then elbowed in the first 10 seconds of the fight.\n\nOur model of a Martial Arts expert gets updated as we see more and more fighters in action, in their real domain fighting - NOT talking, posing, jumping, or meditation. The more we are exposed to MMA, by watching, by talking to these experts or by actually perusing MMA, the more our model improves.\n\nThis new model of expertise is NOT the perfect model of MMA expertise but it is a better model than the naive models that we formed after watching movies or reading stories.\n\n## Fake Expertise - When Models Don't Improve\n\nThere was a time before the UFC when anyone could be an MMA expert. Mixed martial arts or MMA was not popular and anyone that fit in the naive models of an MMA expert could trick you into believing they were an expert.\n\nHere is a guy with a touch of death.\n\nAnd here are some more. (Watch them, they are funnier than those cat videos that you watch in your free time.)\n\nThey could also trick you into following them as disciples and inherit their naive models of expertise.\n\n**Are all of these people intentionally committing fraud?**\n\nSome of them, yes, but not all of them. A lot of them have a flawed conception of what a Martial Arts expert is supposed to be. Some of them believe it so much that they get into a ring with an actual martial artist, and then this happens.\n\nOr this.\n\nMost of them end up looking like this at the end of the fight.\n\n![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F590065a1-2312-4a77-902e-3a39faf4c366_1200x800.jpeg)\n\nPeople who are willing to go in the ring to get punched in the nose, actually believed that they are experts. They actually believe the lie and then transfer this belief to their disciples who then wholeheartedly believe them and promote them. They gain disciples, open gyms, or youtube channels, and make money.\n\nThe same can be said about experts in other fields - not all the people who claim to be experts actually are experts. Go to google or youtube, everyone is an expert.\n\n## Why improve your Model of Expertise?\n\nThe goal of learning is to gain expertise in a domain - to become an expert at something. To become an expert, we have to first find out what real expertise looks like and follow in their footsteps.\n\nThe problem is this - all of us have some naive understanding of expertise in our heads. If we keep using your naive model we might end up wasting your time like the disciples of fake MMA experts. And worse, keep learning, without realising that we are not moving towards expertise until someone breaks our nose - figuratively or literally. \n\n## Spotting Fake Experts\n\nThe magnitude of the fake martial-artist problem significantly decreased after the advent of the UFC. What UFC has done is given them a platform to perform their actual craft in front of the whole world rather than talk in terms of vague, platonic one-liners. They have to walk the walk after talking the talk and all of us can see it. Once that happened, all of us could see the evidence of expertise.\n\n## Evidence\n\nEvidence, evidence, evidence, is the only way to know the truth. This concept is very intuitive to all of us, as long as the evidence is simple and readily available. A singer who can sing well consistently is an expert at singing. A chef whose restaurant is always full is a great chef. We have simple models like these, based on available evidence, and these work most of the time.\n\nBut spotting fake experts is not as easy as this when it comes to complex domains where we either don't have the evidence or we don't know how to interpret evidence. How do you know if someone is an expert philosopher? or a physicist? Or a neuroscientist? What evidence will you seek?\n\nMost accurate will be by measuring their success in the field. You can read their papers, and their book, and know about their inventions, their discoveries and their employers.\n\nBut then how do you understand if a paper is good or bad? Or if having a patent was actually influential in their field? If could make these judgements, great, but most of us seek simpler answers.\n\nOne simple answer is 'their credentials. Check their degrees and certificates. But does having credentials make you an expert? If someone has a degree, they might be good, average, or great. I have a credential in computers, and I for a fact know that I am not an expert.\n\nWhat else? Will you ask about their marks? But then how do you know if their performance in college translates to their real-world expertise?\n\nWhat else? Experience? Resume? Recommendations? There is no end.\n\nHowever, what you need to understand is this - no end is required. Your models will always be inaccurate but that is okay as long as you know the limitations of your models. As we learned from the MMA example, just merely watching the act of real MMA is better than trusting movies. If not, you can see their records or their credentials. You can make your model as accurate as you want, but you need to make it only accurate enough to be useful. Once you are confident enough in your model, you can then use it for predictions. With two conditions - one, understanding that these models are not completely accurate, they may have pitfalls and two, these models can change when new evidence arises.\n\n## Irrelevant Evidence\n\nOne pitfall in the evidence approach is tackling irrelevant evidence. All evidence is not equal. Think about this - if someone has millions of views on their youtube cooking channel, does it make them a great cook?\n\nWatch this hilarious video for an example:\n\nIf you have ever had butter chicken, you know that something is fishy here. Yet there are millions of views on the channel. Views don't prove if someone is a great cook. The alignment of the evidence to the actual statement matters. Yet, we keep making the same mistakes.\n\n## Heuristics\n\nIn the real world, people rarely do this much work before making up their minds on anything. Most of us seek heuristics or rules of thumb to make decisions. One such rule of thumb is, that if people I trust say they are an expert, they must be an expert. Another is, that if a lot of people say they are an expert, they must be an expert. This is social proof. This again is a great model and helps us spot experts however, like any other model, this model of recognising expertise, also has some issues.\n\nOne issue is, again, the irrelevance of evidence. People recommending you items they themselves have no experience with.\n\nAnother is fake proof. What if all the reviews and testimonials, about the person you are trusting as an expert are paid reviews? An example would be someone asking for money to feature you in a magazine or an article. Here is an email I received regarding being featured in a Magazine as an Expert:\n\n![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1b91ff1c-cd20-4d8f-9f65-86e4efa95911_939x282.png)\n\n## Becoming an Expert\n\nTo become an expert, you have to first find out what real expertise looks like. For that, you can build a model of expertise by seeking evidence or applying heuristics like trusting others. Then do the things that they do, and achieve the outcomes that they achieve. All the while keeping in mind that your model is open to change and that it has limitations.\n\n```\nThis is draft no. 1.

Complex problems require hard work in long continuous chunks. That is the only way. It is a tussle that might go on for hours, days, or months. I hate it when people don’t understand that.\n\nAnyone working on a hard, complex problem will fully understand what I mean. But I have found that it gets difficult to communicate to others what it means.\n\nI am writing this post for both you and me so that we can share it with people who don’t understand, and help them understand.\n\n---\n\nDear person in my vicinity,\n\nWhen you see that I am glued to my screen - typing furiously, or writing furiously on a board - I am working. Please don’t talk to me during that time. Infact, don’t even ask me “Could I speak to you for a minute?” You asking me that question will knock me out of my zone.\n\nEven if I just said one sentence “Can we do this later?” I am gone, my context is lost. Now, I am thinking about later. Now I am thinking about the chore that I may have to do later. Now I am thinking about that other meeting where I said “later” too, and how this “later” will clash with that “later”. I am gone, the problem I was solving is still there, but I have lost all my context. I have lost. The problem has won.\n\n  \n\n---\n\nDear person, sometimes I am not furiously typing, I am just staring into the void, for minutes, sometimes hours. I am still in the zone, I am still working. Just because I am not doing any physical activity, does not mean that I am not working, the problem is resolving itself in the back of my mind. I am in the void because I don’t know what to do next, or how to act. But, I am still thinking, I am still wrestling with the problem. As I said, the problem is hard, it will take time. All I ask you is give me that - time that is my own.\n\nTime when you don’t ask me how I am, time when you don’t ask me about the party we planned for the weekend, time when you don’t offer me a snack or tea, or coffee. I know you care. I know you want to be polite. But please, not now. Later.\n\n  \n\n---\n\nDear person, sometimes I will speak to you about the problem. I will come to you and ask you if you can help me brainstorm. Please, only say yes, if you can give the problem your complete attention. You can say no, that is okay. Maybe you will see the expression on my face change when you say no, don’t give in when I do that. I am not disappointed because of you, I am disappointed because I needed someone to solve the problem with me.\n\nIf you give in, and then have to leave 10 minutes later because you have a call scheduled, or you are not fully present, then, and only then, will I be disappointed in you. So, please, dear person, say no, when you have to. That expression on my face - I will not even remember about it in some time. I am obsessed with the problem, I will go back to it, and this memory will dissipate as if it never existed.\n\n  \n\n---\n\nDear person, a no means no. Saying no takes a lot of energy, saying it again, takes 10x more - because I am not a psychopath, you are my friend, and I feel guilty. So if you come to me with a request and I say no, that is it, that means no.\n\nNo in the present. Ten minutes later, or at the end of the day, it might be a yes, but now, right now, when there is a problem I have to solve, a no means no. Please help me solve the problem, by understanding.\n\nHow does it help me? Because for every person around me, 70% percent will not listen to the first no. If you do, you help me save a lot of energy that I can then put towards solving the problem I was solving.\n\n  \n\n---\n\nDear person, shit will hit the fan at all times, things will go wrong at all times, and a customer will be on you at all times. That does not mean all this communication needs to be broadcast to everyone around you in real time. I care about each of those things, and I want to resolve all of those things, but not right now. Right now, I want to stay in the zone and hack at the problem. So, you could put in a Slack message or delay a communication just by a bit, and then we can fight those fires.\n\n---\n\nDear person, you might then ask, “Do I do this for all problems?”, the answer to that is No. You only do that for problems that don’t cause irreversible damage. For example, if someone is withdrawing money from our account, attacking our website, or if the police are at our door, BREAK MY ZONE, WITH PREJUDICE.\n\nHowever, I have noticed that if all the people around me care about what they are doing, and such a big problem has occurred, the worry will be en-masse. The worry will spread organically. But, still, if it does not because you are the only one who notices something mission-critical going wrong, please break my zone. Let me be a bit crude, in such cases - fuck the zone.\n\n  \n\n---\n\nDear person, I know there are a lot of rules. You might ask, “So when can I speak to you?”\n\nThe answer is - when you see me chit-chatting, or when you see me switching between tasks I am doing, one minute I am browsing something on social media, and the next I am watching a video. Or when I am adjusting my chair.\n\nIn short, when you see me care about mundane things, I am available. My chair only bothers me when I am not in the zone. My social media only seems interesting when I am not in the zone. When I am browsing for food I want to order, or when I visibly worry about being hungry, I am not in the zone. In, meetings when no intense discussions are happening, I don't care about the meeting, I am not in the zone (Message me).\n\n---\n\nThe reality is, that I care about mundane things, I care about what’s happening in the world, I care about cats and memes, I care about what I should eat, I care about a lot of things. But when I am solving a problem, these things become hindrances, and they pull me away from the problem. One moment, I am thinking about architecture or a plan, and the next moment when the zone breaks, the cat video on my phone seems super appealing. Because of this, what happens is I am never able to give continuous time to the problem, every time I come close to the solution a break happens, and then I have to start again. Dear person, I seek these things from you because I am weak, and I don’t have the luxury of building myself an isolated space at this time. But, this is what is required if you want me to do my best work. Please help me do my best work.\n","id":"58140efe-c128-4d7a-aff5-7ea63f68e0e1"},"5":{"slug":"beyond-the-code-my-reflections-after","title":"Beyond the Code: my reflections after 365 days of code","shortTitle":"Beyond the Code: my reflections after 365 days of code","description":"","tags":"","heroImage":"","createdAt":"2023-12-23","content":"\n![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff4405180-de4c-4ab4-8581-1865c5626d3c_1024x1024.png)\n\nOn Dec 12, 2023, exactly one year passed since I decided to dedicate my 100 percent attention to being good at programming. I learned many things other than just code during this time. This is just a collection of those things:\n\n#### Minecraft\n\nMy 10-year-old cousin showed me his house in Minecraft, then he showed me his shop, and then his chicken coop, he was passionate about everything he showed me. He kept going back to the game and building new worlds, imaginary but also very real, in some cases, more real than reality. Programming, it seems to me, is just Minecraft for adults, but people can live and interact in the imaginary worlds that you create.\n\n#### Action\n\nProgramming is an Action-first discipline. You learn by writing code - no understanding of the science and history of code. The latter help but without lines of code under your belt, it is all bullshit. All code can be executed, all your hunches can be tested, and all your hypotheses can be disproven.\n\n#### Try\n\nProgramming is also a Trial-first discipline. Things are often easier to figure out by trial and error than by merely thinking about them. Sometimes more information gets uncovered about the problem when you are halfway into the solution, or when you have failed at solving it 3 times. Another way to say the same thing: programming is iterative.\n\n#### Taste\n\nAt the deepest trenches, programming like other domains, relies on taste. The taste of the programmer who wrote a particular library, or a language. A guy, in some dark corner, decided one day that in his language - 2 + 2 = 4, Cat + Cat = CatCat, and Cat + 2 = Cat2, and that was that, millions of people now spend hours debating whether Cat+Cat = CatCat or should it give an error. There are millions on both sides, it is all a matter of taste.\n\n#### English\n\nPeople who tell you that you can be great at programming without being good at English are bullshitting you. Yes, you can start programming - there are a lot of beginner-level tutorials in various languages, and yes some libraries have docs in multiple languages, but the reality of code is that it is English-first. When a new library is released, it is in English, when you go on a forum to learn, those are in English too. A lot of terminology makes sense in English. For example, React is called React because the interface REACTS to the data. And ideas like ‘abstraction’ are far easier to grasp if you know the meaning of the word and how the word is used in domains other than programming.\n\n#### History\n\nI read somewhere in a philosophy book that philosophy is just one long conversation. Someone in Greece started it by asking some questions, another guy answered it 2000 years later in Germany, and today we are still responding to some of the same questions. I think the same can be said about programming. To know why something is the way it is, you must know what existed before it to solve the same problem. Every generation has a new programming paradigm to solve the same age-old problems. Once in a lifetime, new truths are uncovered - like the invention of the microprocessor, or that of the internet, and in our times, the invention of LLMs (transformers). These truths require the creation of new ways of thinking, but other than that we just solve the old problems in new ways.\n\n#### FOMO\n\nMore things happen in the world of programming every day than in any other discipline. Things change, things get better, things get worse, old things die off, and new things are born every, single, day. Programmers live in perpetual fear of missing out. Think of it like this - if you were an English grammar expert, a programming equivalent of your morning would be reading a change log like this\n\nNewEnglishGrammar v0.0.1-early-release\n\n- knife can now be written as nife\n- pronouns can now be capitalized like proper nouns\n- use of the word “might” deprecated, always use “may”\n- million other dumb rules removed\n\nNow, do you upgrade to the New Grammar, or keep using the old one?\n\n#### Thieves\n\nCopying someone else’s code is an accepted practice in code - people call it reuse. Now that I think of it, copying is revered, a programmer is often judged by how good they are at writing reusable code. We are all thieves, copycats.\n","id":"675d6aa8-a922-48ae-860a-787f2c15a866"},"6":{"slug":"books-v-zomato-books-or-zomato","title":"Books v. Zomato. Books or Zomato?","shortTitle":"Books v. Zomato.

There are a whole set of challenges that come with a decision like that - food, laundry, bed, hygiene, etc. Here is how I solved those problems: food - Zomato/Swiggy; laundry - IIT Bombay hostel; bed - sleeping bag; hygiene - IITB hostel, friend's home, office restrooms. Saying that I solved the problem of hygiene would be a bit too much, let's say I managed it enough for people to be able to work with me, most of the time.\n\n![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4fdc4ae0-f212-4b99-b70f-bc8d4b6450e3_2232x1488.jpeg)\n\nMy reason - I thought it was more efficient. It truly was - my travel time to work was 5-10 seconds, no rent, no utilities, no home maintenance, no moral policing. You save the two most valuable resources for humans - time and money. Along with that, you get the freedom to spend your time and money whenever you want and however you want. \n\nWatchmen - the first line of defence for a housing society's morality - are different in business parks. They don't judge you or report you to your landlords. They don't care, in a good way. I learned two things from this. First, watchmen are not the root cause of pain to the tenants. They are acting out of self-preservation by adhering to the norms of their employer. Second, the norms of morality and society in places of business are different from norms of morality and society in places of residence. These norms are redefined, and often relaxed, under the premise of *ease of doing business*.\n\nHow does one spend their spares - spare time, spare money and spare freedom? \n\nAt that time, I spent them on two things - ordering food on Zomato & partying. A hundred per cent of freedom was spent on partying and about seventy per cent of my spare money and time was spent on food. I saved nothing. It was either order in or dine out. I ordered food every day for more than a year. Barring the days on which someone got a homemade lunch for me, I was always in a paradox of choice of restaurants, thrice a day. It came to a point where I had to create a google sheet with my food and restaurant preferences to make the decision easier.\n\n## Books or Zomato?\n\nAt that time, I was not in a habit of reading books. I always wanted to read more but I didn't. One reason for it was that I did not buy a lot of books. I thought they were expensive. Once or twice a month, I would open Amazon to buy a book, look a the price tag of Rs 300 - 500, and then say - too expensive. Until one day I sat down and calculated the amount of money I was spending on food. The number baffled me. When I compared it to the cost of the books, that I deemed too expensive to buy, it baffled me even more. According to the calculation, if I spent 30 per cent less on my food, I could buy one book a day - not one book a month, or a week - one book a day. I could buy more books than I could ever finish reading in just a couple of years. Math that defies your own intuition is the most impactful. You can't forget it or hide from it. So, the math stuck with me - one book a day!\n\n## Zomato and Books.\n\nThereafter, every-time I started ordering, a question popped into my head - books or Zomato? It was hard to choose 'book' each time but I started choosing it a lot more. I was ordering more books than I have ever ordered. Books seemed cheap now. In a couple of months after that, I ordered at least 20 books. That changed everything. I haven't felt a deficiency in reading ever since. In the end, I had both - Zomato and Books. \n\nI think people read more when they buy more books. But why don't people buy more books? One of the reasons is the perception that reading is an expensive habit - books are costly. For the people who aren't ordering food online, I agree. For others, I disagree and here is the math to prove it. \n\n_I have used Zomato's figures because they were readily available, however, I think that these numbers will hold true for other ordering platforms too._\n\nOn average, a Zomato user orders 3.6 times per month. Each time they order, they spend somewhere around 375 on it. So, on average, a Zomato user spends 1350 on Zomato per month. If you place more than 3.6 orders per month, you spend more - order once a week and the number become 1500 per month. \n\nNow, if you choose to spend 300-500 less on Zomato per month, you could buy one book a month for the rest of your lives. In 5 years, you would have 50 books - way more than what an average person reads in their lifetime. There are many ways in which you can achieve this - reducing order frequency by one, choosing cheaper places, getting better discounts, using multiple applications, etc. The point is this - it is very very easy to do and you should do it. You should buy more books. \n\nYou just have to ask yourself a question - Books or Zomato, and you will end up with both Zomato and Books.\n\n```\nPlease report any errors - factual or grammatical - in comments or messages.\n\nInspired by: Books v.

To me, it seemed like a fair question and a question that deserved a proper answer.\n\nThis post is my answer.\n\n## The Short Answer\n\nHow do I know about something without experiencing it myself?\n\nThe short and blunt answer would be 'because of science'.\n\nIf you understand the logic leap, you can skip the rest of the post, or else you can read on.\n\n## Direct & Indirect Experience\n\nYes, the simplest way to know something is true would be actually experiencing it for yourself. Let's call this type of knowing - knowing from direct experience.\n\n\"The sky is blue\", you know it because you can experience it.\n\nAnd certainly, this way of knowing from direct experience may lead to strong impressions and lasting models in your mind. For example, I lived in Mumbai for 10 years and I know from experience that the rains in Mumbai can be devastating. No amount of reading or watching documentaries could have prepared me for that truth.\n\n![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F325eb227-fbde-476e-877d-792ac491aadd_800x1000.jpeg)\n\nHowever, this method of knowing is very inefficient. Think about this, if every person decided that they would only believe the things they have experienced, then knowing simple truths like 'Delhi is in north India' and \"Mosquitoes spread malaria\" would actually require them to experience those events.\n\nA better way would be to learn from other people's experiences. I can know something by either talking to other people who have direct experience or by reading books written by them. Let's call this method of knowing - knowing from indirect experience. Through indirect experience, I can know, without experiencing it myself, that mosquitoes cause malaria or that Delhi is in north India, or that vaccines work against Covid-19.\n\n## The Truth Machine\n\nBut what if someone lies about their direct experience? For example, if they say, \"I went to the Himalayas and I saw a man with the head of a lion.\" Would you still learn from this experience?\n\nOr what if someone is deceived by their experience? For example, what if someone says \"I had herbal tea while I had Covid-19 and I got better. Therefore, herbal tea cures Covid-19\". Would you still believe them?\n\n![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa6030993-a88d-4858-80c5-cb496a8afba8_848x1200.jpeg)\n\n\"No\", I hear you saying as you wince. \"These statements look obviously false. It is just common sense.\"\n\nBut, what if situations start getting a bit trickier? Consider, \"All the land I can see is flat, therefore the earth is flat.\" or, \"I can see the sun moving in the sky, it is very obvious that the sun moves around the earth.\" Again both these statements seem obviously false, but humans believed both of them for thousands of years.\n\n\"9/10 dentists recommend this toothpaste and therefore it is good.\" Would you believe this statement to be true?\n\n![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F268e7a92-5df5-447e-93fa-4a84e79e1b68_1488x992.jpeg)\n\nSo, how do you know which indirect experience to trust and which not to?\n\nWe currently live in an age where we collectively trust a method of finding the truth, called science. Science is humanity's truth machine (or a lie detector). Science allows us to create Humanity's knowledge base - a set of truths that all humans around the world can trust.\n\nAnything that is found out by the scientific method officially goes into this knowledge base and anything that does not stays out. Often there are situations where something that was found out to be scientific in the past, is later refuted and kicked out of the knowledge base, and vice-versa.\n\n\"All the land I can see is flat, therefore the earth is flat.\" \"I can see the sun moving in the sky, it is very obvious that the sun moves around the earth.\" A scientist would ask questions like:\n\n- What experiments were performed to test these statements?\n- What here the methods and instruments used for testing?\n- What are the predictions that can be made if these statements were true?\n\n\"9/10 dentists recommend this toothpaste and therefore it is good.\" A scientist would ask questions like\n\n- How many dentists were surveyed in total?\n- How were the questions asked?\n- Who asked the questions?\n- Were these dentists paid by the toothpaste company?\n\nSuch questions test the validity of the experience and help us be certain about the truth of these statements. If the statements pass the test of science, they are deemed scientific truths - truths all of us can trust.\n\n**Which indirect experiences can you trust?**\n\nThe answer is very obvious now - the scientific ones. If the indirect experience is scientific, you can trust it, if it is not, you can't.\n\n## On the Shoulders of Giants\n\nIf you take a minute and think about all the things you think you know, very soon you will realize that you have NOT directly experienced most of them. Yet, a lot of us keep making the same mistake of assuming that the best form of learning happens from direct experience. Or we keep on giving excuses like, \"I don't read. I learn from real-world experience\".\n\n> \"Fools say they learn by experience. I prefer to profit by other people's experience.” - Bismarck\n\nThe learning that you can have from the real world that you can experience during your lifetime, is insignificant when compared with humanity's collective knowledge. The great gift of science is that you don't need to experience everything yourself, you can trust the experience of others if it is scientific and take their work forward. This is, in fact, the way in which scientific innovations happen - by building on the work of people before you, by trusting their experience.\n\nOnce you start learning from indirect experience, your own direct experience can be significantly better because of the perspective and the context that you have. You can avoid the mistakes others made, you can follow the signposts they laid, or you can take their work forward by picking up where they left. You can look farther by standing on the shoulders of giants.\n\n> \"If I have seen further it is by standing on the shoulders of Giants\" - Isaac Newton\n\n## The Complete Answer\n\nHow do I know about something without experiencing it myself?\n\n**I know without experience because I have learned from the indirect experience of others who followed the scientific method to record their experience.**\n\n```\nThe idea of direct and indirect exprience is inspired by the writings of B. H. Liddell Hart.\n\nRequest: Please point out any logical or grammatical errors.

Try it.\\]**\n\nTake out your phone. Open WhatsApp, and start typing “I love”. The autocomplete on your phone will probably predict “you” as the next word. That’s it. That’s how all chat-based AIs like ChatGPT work. They predict what comes next.\n\nLet’s go into a bit more detail.\n\nIn a chat-based AI system - there are usually two predefined roles:\n\n1.  User\n2.  AI Assistant\n\nA conversation keeps alternating between them.\n\n### First Message\n\nWhen you send it a message:\n\n> User: How are you?\n\nThe AI accepts the input and tries to autocomplete the reply.\n\n> User: How are you?\n>\n> AI Assistant: &lt;autocompletes here&gt;\n\nThere is no thinking, no logic, no engines, no magic. Just autocomplete.\n\nPrediction works like this\n\n> User: How are you?\n>\n> AI Assistant: I\n>\n> AI Assistant: I am\n>\n> AI Assistant: I am doi\n>\n> AI Assistant: I am doing\n>\n> AI Assistant: I am doing we\n>\n> AI Assistant: I am doing well.\n\nHere is an explanation:\n\n> AI Assistant: I\n>\n> AI Assistant: I am\n>\n> **\\[\\`am\\` is added because an equation inside the AI says that ‘am’ is the next most likely thing.\\]**\n>\n> AI Assistant: I am doi\n>\n> _**\\[\\` doi\\` is added because an equation inside the AI says that \\`a space followed by doi\\` is the next most likely thing\\]**_\n>\n> AI Assistant: I am doing\n>\n> _**\\[… so on, the next most likely thing is added next.\\]**_\n>\n> AI Assistant: I am doing we\n>\n> AI Assistant: I am doing well.\n>\n> _**\\[… the process continues until the equations says ‘that’s the end’\\]**_\n\nTwo things result from this:\n\n1.  You get that typing effect on AIs, where characters or words are added, one by one.\n2.  You get the illusion that a human on the other side is speaking to you.\n\n_For Geeks: The next thing predicted is neither always a character, nor a word, it is a segment of the language formally called a token. All chat based AI systems predict the next token. Examples of tokens could be - doi, ng, well,., etc._\n\n### Second Message\n\nWhen you send another message.\n\n> User: How are you?\n>\n> AI Assistant: I am doing well.\n>\n> **User: What is the full-form of AI?**\n\nThe whole conversation - all three messages - is sent to the AI again and the autocomplete starts again.\n\n> User: How are you?\n>\n> AI Assistant: I am doing well.\n>\n> User: What is the full-form of AI?\n>\n> **AI Assistant: AI stands for Artificial Intelligence.**\n\nThis is what the process looks like.\n\n1.  You send a message.\n2.  The Whole conversation is sent to the AI.\n3.  AI does the completion.\n4.  Go to step 1.\n\nAs I said earlier, it’s just autocomplete like your phone, but better.\n\n### How does AI know what comes next?\n\nThe answer to that is learning; or what you would call in education lingo - cramming. The AI has gone through all the texts on the internet many times and over time it starts cramming (learning) what comes next. I call it cramming because all an AI knows is what comes next, it does not understand the meaning of your message.\n\nWhen I say AI - I don’t mean a magical computer being, it is just a very very long mathematical equation that calculates the chances of what comes next. This equation is sometimes also called a model.\n\nWhen you use ChatGPT free, the model (the equation) is GPT 3.5, when you purchase a paid version, you get a new, better model/equation called GPT 4.\n\nThe better the model, the better the responses.\n\n### Customizing ChatGPT\n\nWhat if you want your ChatGPT to always speak to you like “A Rapper”, or take any other role like a doctor or a scientist? How does one do that?\n\nIt is quite simple. Just insert some instructions before the chat starts.\n\n> Instructions: Always speak to me like a rapper.\n>\n> ![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4e0722ca-b815-401e-8e6f-74b9b6ec09c5_498x710.png)\n\nYou can add these instructions on the free version of ChatGPT too. Just google “how to add custom instructions to GPT”.\n\n## What to do with this knowledge?\n\n1.  Be careful with math: Since everything is just autocomplete, no GPT or chat-based AI can do math with 100 accuracy. All it can do is guess - what comes after 2+2=, and 99.999 times out of 100, the answer would be 4.\n2.  Beware of conversation length: As the conversation gets longer, most chat-based AIs forget older messages. The newer messages are often given more priority than older messages.\n3.  Add clear custom instructions: If you ask the model to be a doctor, and then ask it a medical question, the response would be better than just asking it that question directly. This happens because while answering, the AI tries to complete the sentence “As an expert doctor, I recommend that you ….”, as compared to “I am not an expert doctor, but I think…”.\n4.  Don’t make typos or grammatical errors: The quality of the responses also depends on the quality of the questions. If the questions are clear, not filled with errors, and grammatically correct, there is a better chance of getting a better response.\n","id":"a6987069-dc46-4442-b67c-8e20e95dd0d4"},"10":{"slug":"does-graduating-from-iims-and-iits","title":"Does graduating from IIMs and IITs matter? ","shortTitle":"Does graduating from IIMs and IITs matter? ","description":"","tags":"","heroImage":"","createdAt":"2021-03-11","content":"The Problem\n-----------\n\nA child, from a middle-class family, has just cracked a competitive exam - take the CAT for the sake of example. Based on her score, she applies to several colleges and gets accepted into two of them in the MBA program of her choice. Now she has to make a choice, but she faces a dilemma - one college is ranked higher than the other in the all-India rankings for MBA programs while the other is cheaper. Which one should she choose?\n\nHere are the options in more detail:\n\nCollege 1: \n\n-   College Rank: 3rd in the country\n    \n-   Fees: 9 lakhs per year\n    \n-   The average salary of graduates: 16 lakhs per annum\n    \n\nCollege 2:\n\n-   College Rank: 15th in the country\n    \n-   Fees: 0.5 lakhs per year\n    \n-   The average salary of graduates: is 9 lakhs per annum\n    \n\nTake a moment and try to think through this problem.\n\nThe Solution\n------------\n\nAlbert-László Barabási, a network scientist, has tried to answer this question based on data - not on anecdotes, logic, or probability theory - just on data. What follows are findings from his research. I will keep them lean. My aim here is to cut all the fat, come straight to the point, and support each finding with one example. If you want to go in-depth or require more examples, read the first three chapters of his book - _The Formula_. \n\nHere is what the research points out. \n\nThe Role of Performance\n-----------------------\n\n**In situations where performance can be measured, performance drives success, not the college.** \n\nIn this particular case, since CAT scores are the measures of performance, the success of the child only depends on the CAT scores, NOT the college she chooses. If she scores 99.98 in CAT, then her success - her salary - will be equal to the salary of any other child who scores 99.98 in the CAT, irrespective of the college they are in. The higher-ranked college will result in the same outcomes as the lower-ranked one. The cheaper college will result in the same outcomes as the costlier one. \n\nSo, if she has a tighter budget, she can save money by choosing a cheaper college. If budget is not a problem and she wants better facilities or location, she can choose the costlier one, if that works for her. I repeat, her chances of success, that is the salary she earns, will not change based on the college.\n\nThe Role of Ambition\n--------------------\n\nPerformance, when measurable, is just one factor that determines success. There is another factor - ambition. While Barabási was doing his research, he found a fascinating relationship between ambition and success. Quoting him:\n\n_\"After accounting for all performance measures for students, such as SAT scores and rankings in their high school class, the key factor determining income a decade after graduation was not the college they attended. The single determinant of long-term success was derived from the best college a kid merely applied to, even if she didn’t get in. \"_\n\nTo understand this, again consider another situation - a child scores 99.98 in CAT and has the following colleges to which she can apply to:\n\nCollege 1: \n\n-   College Rank: 1st in the country\n    \n-   Salary of graduates with 99.98 in CAT = 18 lakhs per annum\n    \n\nCollege 2: \n\n-   College Rank: 3rd in the country\n    \n-   Salary of graduates with 99.98 in CAT = 12 lakhs per annum\n    \n\nCollege 3: \n\n-   College Rank: 5th in the country\n    \n-   Salary of graduates with 99.98 in CAT = 10 lakhs per annum\n    \n\nCollege 4: \n\n-   College Rank: 10th in the country\n    \n-   Salary of graduates with 99.98 in CAT = 8 lakhs per annum\n    \n\nAlso, keep in mind that MBA colleges, while accepting children, also consider factors other than CAT scores like essays, experience, schooling, etc. Two children with similar CAT scores may get accepted or rejected based on these factors.  \n\nWhat the research shows is this -\n\n-   If she applies to College 1 and gets rejected, she earns 18 lakhs per annum.\n    \n-   If she applies to College 2 & gets rejected, she earns 12 lakhs per annum.\n    \n-   If she applies to College 3 & gets rejected, she earns 10 lakhs per annum.\n    \n\nThe college which she graduates from does not matter, the college she applies to determines her success. The mere fact she applies shows her ambition and that, along with her performance, drives her success.\n\nAfter a decade of graduation, the salary of a child with a CAT score of 99.98 graduating from College 4, is equal to the Salary of a child with a CAT score of 99.98 graduating from College 1, given that she applied to College 1. \n\n_\"In other words, it’s performance and ambition—where she thinks she belongs—that determine your child's success.\"_\n\nThe Formula for Success\n-----------------------\n\n**If performance is measurable, Success = Performance + Ambition.**\n\n```\nReference: The Formula: The Universal Laws of Success by Albert-László Barabási\n\nNote: Please comment if you find any errors.\n```\n","id":"07b05635-05e2-4308-ad7b-19d356a01f4a"},"11":{"slug":"elevating-your-online-reading-experience","title":"Elevating Your Online Reading Experience","shortTitle":"Elevating Your Online Reading Experience","description":"","tags":"","heroImage":"","createdAt":"2023-01-04","content":"\nHere are three tips that will help you if you are someone who reads a lot of articles on your laptop.\n\n![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fef5db6d1-ab3f-43ab-881b-f9aaeb0d6a03_4752x3168.jpeg)\n\nI read, therefore I am.\n\n# 1\\. Adapt, for Readability\n\nThe internet is full of amazing articles that are cursed with borderline unreadable web design. Reading articles with bad web design puts the same amount of stress on your mind as reading bad handwriting does. Pick up and try reading any handwritten medical prescription from your drawer, and you will know that the stress is real.\n\n![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbbd2159e-239b-4b61-a8e3-7b0b783c2021_5092x3395.jpeg)\n\nThe stress is REAL.\n\nThe first thing I do, when I sit to read an article that I have committed to reading, is to make it readable by adjusting how the text appears on the screen, aka typography. I do this with the help of third-party extensions or apps. This allows me to fine-tune my readability experience and it keeps my reading experience consistent across sites.\n\nThese apps/extensions allow me to control the following:\n\n- font\n- font size\n- background-color\n- width\n- line-height\n\nThe first three are a matter of preference. But not the last two. You can immensely decrease the stress on your eyes and mind by keeping the columns narrow and the line heights tall.\n\nNarrow columns work because you don’t have to move your head as you read. All the work of reading is done by just moving your eyes. And tall line heights mean that there is more space between two lines on your screen. This works because you can easily go from one line to another as you read.\n\nI keep the column wide enough to keep around 15 words in one line of text. For line height, I keep it at least 1.5 times (150%) the height of the font. This means that if the height of your font is 16px, there will be 24px, i.e., 150% space between the lines.\n\n#### Omnivore\n\nI personally use Omnivore as my reading app. You are free to choose from the wide options on the Chrome extension store. Two other options are Mercury Reader and Clearly Reader.\n\nHere is a screenshot of an article without any Omnivore processing.\n\n![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa812a08c-d5ee-4eeb-a707-6f15e1842175_692x485.png)\n\nHere is a screenshot of the same after processing my text with Omnivore.\n\n![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb4a00242-48f6-43a0-a3dc-0d5b316673ca_1085x780.png)\n\nOne more thing, if you are reading at night, in a dark room, I recommend keeping your background color sepia - or any other brownish tone.\n\n![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5004dea9-a10f-4b38-b601-e13eabc4b1f5_4032x3024.jpeg)\n\nAre you a night owl, like me?\n\n#### Wikiwand\n\nIf you read Wikipedia a lot, I recommend using Wikiwand. It automatically processes all Wikipedia pages for readability every time you open a Wikipedia page. It also has tons of other options. Here is a screenshot of a Wikipedia article after Wikiwand has done its magic:\n\n![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff884c427-5c26-4eba-ac0f-ebf6a5518f9f_1920x965.png)\n\n## 2\\. Annotate, for Engagement\n\nI love the feeling of the pen in hand when I read a book – I can fidget with it, I can underline the text, or I can take notes in the margin. I don’t know if all of these things are actually beneficial for retention in the long term, but what I know is this – they keep me engaged. I think of it like this – a pencil is to reading what music is to running.\n\nIn the same spirit, I like to annotate articles that I read on the web. My objective is not to take great notes but to keep myself involved with the article. What highlights or notes I take, and if those are useful, are inconsequential as long as the process of annotation keeps me going. As I said before, it’s like music for my reading.\n\n![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F14c9deb9-dec1-424c-87bb-dbdfd601d1dc_4752x3168.jpeg)\n\nDon’t just read, get those hands out!\n\nI use Omnivore for annotations. There are apps like Pocket, Evernote, Readwise, etc that allow you to do much more than annotation but over 10 years of reading online, I have realized that the simpler I keep my reading workflow, the better it is for me. Hence, Omnivore.\n\n## 3\\. Annotate, to Slow Down\n\nAll of our digital devices are optimized for scrolling, not reading. So, most of us don't read online; we scroll and maybe, just maybe, read the headlines if they are bold enough. Therefore, a key to reading online is resisting the urge to scroll. I have two tips for slowing down.\n\nThe first is simple, don’t touch your mouse or touchpad as you read. Scroll with the keyboard and voila, your scrolling ability is reduced by an order of magnitude.\n\nThe second is to annotate as you read. Annotations, in addition to keeping you engaged, will automatically slow down your scrolling speed. This will give you more time to sit with a paragraph or a point and understand it better. Here too, the quality of annotations does not matter, the objective is to slow down.\n\nWhatever you do, remember to read, not scroll.\n\n![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3c8bec1c-938f-4b8b-b461-1293df18f969_3586x4781.jpeg)\n\nThank you.

Let's explore it a bit more.\n\nWhy is Engagement important?\n----------------------------\n\nNeuroscientists have consistently found that learning happens when students form and strengthen connections in their brains. The point to note here is this - 'students form the connections', teachers can't do it on behalf of the students. So, technically speaking, teaching is just helping students learn i.e., form connections in their brains. Unlike a computer, teachers can't connect a USB cable and transfer the content directly into the brain of the students.\n\nThere is a fixed path through which learning happens. Students have to first pay attention to what they want to learn, then temporarily store it in their short-term memory, and finally transfer it to their long-term storage over time. Therefore, we can safely assume that learning starts with students paying attention to what they want to learn. And since engagement just means 'paying attention', it has penetrated so effectively into teaching and learning vocabulary, and rightly so.\n\nThe use of engagement in the learning process is further jargonized into 'Active Learning', i.e., learning that happens when children are engaged. But, can learning to be passive? If learning means making and strengthening connections in the brain, and all connection formation requires attention, then technically, all learning is active. It is impossible for any connections to form when students are not paying attention.\n\nSo, engagement is important for learning. But it is just one part of the puzzle. The effectiveness of classrooms can't be predicted on the basis of engagement alone, it depends on the alignment between engagement and learning goals.\n\nWhat are the Goals of Learning?\n-------------------------------\n\nHow do we know what children already know? And if they are learning more? The best way to know would be to actually see and measure the connections in the brains, physically in some way - may be by sticking electrodes in the brain or by imaging techniques like fMRI. Alas, teachers can't do it in real time and, at the moment, neither can't neuroscientists. So what is the alternative?\n\nEducators use Learning Outcomes, Learning Goals, or Learning Objectives. These are simple statements that define what students should be able to do after they have learned a concept or an idea. Here are some [examples](https://cwsei.ubc.ca/sites/default/files/cwsei/resources/instructor/Learning_Goals_at_UBC_and_CU_examples.pdf).\n\nThe principle behind using learning goals is this - since we can't measure learning directly, we observe and measure the actions of students and then infer(guess) their learning from these actions. The observations of these actions may be in the day-to-day classroom or during assessments.\n\nIn principle, learning goals are just a different tool to understand and gauge a student's learning (like electrodes, fMRI, a weighing scale, or a psychiatric assessment). They are a human-understandable way to model connections that students have formed in their brains.\n\nSo, teachers first break down a course into some bigger goals to define the destination or learning. Then they break down these big goals into smaller goals so that they can consistently measure the direction in which the learning is happening. The classrooms are then designed in such a way that the goals are achieved and the assessments are designed in such a way that you can measure student actions to validate the achievement of the learning goals.\n\nNow we know three truths:\n-------------------------\n\n-   Learning happens when connections form in the brain and these connections start forming when the students are engaged.\n    \n-   Learning goals are our hack to model learning.\n    \n-   Assessments are our way to measure if the learning goals were achieved.\n    \n\nBut most of us simplify these truths into three heuristics.\n\n-   Engagement tells us 'how students learn'\n    \n-   Learning goals tell us 'what students need to learn’\n    \n-   Assessments tell us 'what students have learned'\n    \n\nMost teachers I have interviewed know these heuristics. Most lesson planners aka. curriculum designers I know, also know these heuristics.\n\n**And yet they consistently confront the following situation - the learning goals were created, the classroom was engaging and yet students failed in the assessment.**\n\nAll Engagement is NOT Equal\n---------------------------\n\nA principle should be obvious by this point - if students engage with X, they can learn X. It is simple, so so simple. Yet we ignore this principle all the time. Here are a few examples:\n\n1.  If you are teaching a poem and while doing so jump around the classroom and keep the students engaged, the engagement leads to the following learning - our teacher is funny, she can jump really high, etc.\n    \n2.  Let's say you are teaching children about Isaac Newton and as an activity to keep students engaged, ask students to paint an apple and then later relate it to the fact that 'an apple fell on Newton's head and he discovered gravity'. In this case, students learn to paint an apple, because they are engaged in painting, not Newton and gravity.\n    \n3.  Let's say you ask students to play a game of 'Never have I Ever' at the beginning of the class to keep them engaged, and then start teaching them 'Nouns'. In this case, too, children learn how to play the game, not Nouns.\n    \n4.  The same goes for other fluff like irrelevant videos, making them run around the class, making them play games, and other engagement-inducing mumbo-jumbo that is NOT aligned with the actual learning goals.\n    \n\nAll this mumbo-jumbo is useless when it comes to learning. The aim of the activity is NOT to simply keep the students engaged, but to keep them engaged in alignment with the learning goals. I will henceforth call such learning activities that don't directly align with the learning goals as 'Fluffy Activities'. Fluffy Activities might help you keep students busy, and parents happy, or even sell a few courses but one thing they will not do is help children learn.\n\n**I repeat, engagement only helps in learning when engagement is aligned with the learning goals, everything else is just fluff.**\n\nBullshit in Education\n---------------------\n\nSo, is everyone lying about engagement? No, they are not, some of them are innocently naïve, but most of them are just bullshitting.\n\nLying requires one to be deceptive, to intentionally withhold the truth. Bullshitting is different - it is NOT caring about the truth. 'A liar cares about the truth and attempts to hide it; the bullshitter doesn't care if what they say is true or false, but cares only whether the listener is persuaded.' A bullshitter makes up facts according to their convenience without caring about the truth.\n\nMost people don't care about what the truth about learning is, they care about what is in demand and what makes the child/parent happy. They say and do whatever it takes to persuade the child, or the parent, or their boss, or their principal, of the fact that the learning is happening.\n\nParents want activities - add more activities to the classroom. Parents want assessments - add more tests. The sales team wants videos, games, and fun, give it to them. The principal says, do project-based learning - so do it. A motivational speaker says, make the classroom student-centric, so do it. **Do whatever it takes to persuade others that students are learning or will learn, that's bullshit!**\n\nSo, if you are adding fluffy activities to the classroom without doing your research about learning, you are a bullshitter! If you are adding fluffy activities to the classroom to persuade the parents that their children will learn, you are also a bullshitter! And, if you know the principles of learning and are still doing it, you are a liar!\n\nAvoiding Bullshit & Surprises\n-----------------------------\n\nTo the ones who are discovering these ideas for the first time - you shouldn't be surprised when students fail in an assessment after an engaging classroom. Engagement does not guarantee learning. Even, if engagement aligned to learning goals just starts the process of learning, it does not guarantee it. There is a lot more to it, so it is better to learn more about learning, instead of bullshitting about it.\n\nTo the ones who want to avoid bullshit, just make sure that you enquire more about the truth when someone is giving you complicated jargon. Another thing is not being satisfied with the sentence 'according to research', ask more. And if you are still curious, there is a whole [course on bullshit by the University of Washington](https://www.callingbullshit.org/videos.html).\n\nBest of luck!\n\n```\nNote: This is draft no. 1 and will evolve over time in both logic and compostition.

A two-page 'word document' that was supposed to guide a teacher on how to carry out a teaching session. I remember thinking - wow! this is so magical, so beautiful, so elegant. \n\nLesson plans were a revelation for me, especially taking into account where I come from. I taught a class of 40 students for the first time when I was 17, at a private school in my hometown of Poonch, J&K. Poonch is smaller than a typical locality in a metro city. There, teachers came to class and winged it, from their notes or the textbook - they had no exhaustive plans. The lessons had an outline, but there was no lesson plan. These plans I saw, however, were detailed and had things like - teacher actions, student actions, expected responses, exercises, strategies, etc. It blew my mind. \n\nAll lesson plans started with one thing and one thing only, an acronym, SWBAT. I did not understand SWBAT at all and therefore, it added to the enigma of the plan. I went to \"S\" and asked, what it meant. S was leading the education team at our company at that time -- he was supposed to be the Ed co-founder in our Ed-tech company. S helped me a lot, and took the veil off the word for me. He explained that it stood for - Students Will Be Able To. He then described how SWBAT was supposed to be followed by a measurable action that the student is able to perform in the classroom. \n\n\"SWBAT dance at the end of the class.\" Or, more realistically - \n\n\"SWBAT explain Photosynthesis at the end of the class.\"\n\nIt was a standard to write a 'Learning Objective' of the lesson, he said. And, that it had to be observable and measurable. And like other great teachers, he went on to explain more, and more and more. He started uttering words I had never heard before - Piaget, Bloom, Taxonomy, Dewey, Scaffolding, Pedagogy. I think I started to feel like an idiot around the second minute of the conversation. I knew that Piaget was a noun, but whether it was a person, a place, a thing, or a concept, I had no idea. Was Pedagogy a female scientist? Does taxonomy have to do something with taxes? How are taxes relevant to a lesson plan? I was mesmerized by all the complexity. I adored what I could not understand. I think humans tend to do that - deify what they can't understand. \n\n> I think humans tend to do that - deify what they can't understand. \n\nThen, one day S left. While he was there, he got the lesson plans made by freelancers, and my job was to find videos for the lesson plans that had already been made. One of those days, we realized that the lesson plans that were already made were not compatible with the company's vision and so, we ditched them all. Now, we had to recreate them, and since S had no interest in creating the plans himself -- he had made hundreds in his time and now he felt that the job was monotonous -- he started training other people to make the plans. I was one of them. I started making my first plan, and S did all the scaffolding -- Ed-speak for hand-holding -- and in 3 days, the plan was made. S checked it, I still remember the frustration on his face as he was doing it, and ended up reluctantly rewriting 80 percent of it. This went on for 2 more weeks and around 10 more plans. Then, one day S left. We were left with no Ed-founder in the Ed-tech company. \n\nWithout S, I thought WSBAT - Will Students Be Able To?\n\n```\nEndnote:\n\nI don't have any peers to review this post.

I received it four months into the job. I, now, had to accept a job offer for a job I had already been doing for four months. The feeling of signing a contract like that was different, or better explained by words often uttered by my then-founder - familiar yet different. The designation - Author. Four months ago, I had completed my engineering degree in \"Computer Suff\", and now George R.R. Martin and I had the same designation. \n\n\"S\" left behind, by his holy decree, three newly ordained 'lesson planners' including me. All of us were engineers and all of us with zero lesson planning experience before the 10 plans that we had just made. The other two were IITans, one of whom got drunk one fateful night, cursed us all, and we never saw him again. He left his T-shirts and a watch behind, which the rest of us split after he remained AWOL for three more months. What happened to him, and why he left, is still a mystery. \n\nTwo engineers with zero experience in lesson planning, making lesson plans that were supposed to 'revolutionize education'. We were in a position where we had to create the art that we were appreciating as spectators, a week ago. We were the chefs who were to cook a dish, without even knowing what the well-made version of that dish tasted like. Couldn't we have hired other people? We could have, but it would have been too late. For me to give you a complete picture, I will first have to explain the basics of an Ed-tech business. \n\nAll Ed-tech businesses, for-profits or non-profits, at their core have three teams - Ed, Tech, and Business. The Business and the Tech teams inside an Ed-tech are usually, and quite innovatively, named Business and Tech teams. Naming the Ed team, however, is a completely different deal. The name is driven more by philosophy or outward appearance, than by actual function. I think these names tell you more about the thinking of the founders than the actual purpose of the team. \n\nIf your founder has a business background - Content Team. If your founder has some passion or background in education - Education Team, Learning Team, Development Team, Academic Team, or Knowledge Team. If your founder has a flair for marketing or has hired someone in marketing, the names start getting complicated - Academic Excellence Team, Learning Design Team, Instructional Design Team, Learning & Development Team. And if you join a company and your team has a bizarre name like - Harbinger of Learning Team, Devourers of Knowledge Team, Instructional Design Daredevils, or anything that ends with Samurais/Ninjas/Rockstars - good luck.\n\nIn all, no matter the name, there are just three moving parts in all Ed-tech businesses - Ed, Tech, and Business. One that makes things, one that makes a platform for the things that are made, and one that sells the platform. \n\nOur startup was no different. \"Make learning fun for children by creating better lesson plans and hiring great teachers.\" That was the Ed part. \"Facilitate this with an app.\" That was the tech part. \"Make money by keeping a cut of the fees that children pay and handing the rest over to the teachers.\" That was the business part. \n\nOf the three parts, we had two parts -- Business and Tech -- figured out. Selling is storytelling and we told beautiful stories. We had already sold the program to some parents. Also, we onboarded the teachers to teach the initial batches of children. The business part was a go. \n\nBusiness people, especially salespeople, are impatient people. They want to 'close' customers - Startup-speak for selling something to people - and they want to close them fast. For their job, this attitude is a feature, not a bug. They are rewarded for it. But in an Ed-tech startup or generally any product-based startup, this attitude 'bugs' the people making the product. For us, it was the Tech and Ed teams that were bugged. These classes were happening next Monday, D-day. And the classes were to happen six days a week for Math, Science, and English in 2 batches. \n\nThe Tech team, just one person at that time, got bugged but said that we could use some presentation software and PDFs to do the job at an acceptable level. He would keep building and updating the platform as time passes. That was his D-day plan. So, Tech was also a go. \n\nNow there was just one more thing to do - Ed. We had to make the content -- Ed-Speak for lesson plans, exercises, charts, and everything else that goes into conducting a class -- and make it now. It was D-day minus 7. If we slacked, then the teacher would have nothing to teach on D-day. So, if you ask me - Couldn't you hire people? No my friend, not today. Today, we were to revolutionize education. \n\n![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe0dcb3fc-c286-4da8-bd4d-cc499d5f5a83_1325x723.png)\n\n```\nSidenote: There are also some other, less education-centric businesses that are classified as Ed-tech. They might help administration manage schools, or help teachers get students, or help students/teachers collaborate.

Word by word. Line by line. One punctuation mark at a time. But why? Why convert a perfectly good-looking doc into this gibberish? Couldn't we have just sent the content to teachers, as it was? Maybe, we could have. But there is more to it than what meets the eye. To understand it, let's go one step deeper into the world of the Ed-tech business. \n\n### Pythagoras to Gutenberg\n\nTwo out of three parts of the Ed-tech business - Ed and Business - are almost as old as humanity itself. Ed part has existed since the time humans realized that some of them were more knowledgeable/skilled than others and then decided that it would be best for everyone to share this knowledge.\n\nAs for business, the history is a bit complicated but very old. Humans have always competed for what goes into young brains and how. Teachers have always competed with other teachers, and schools with other schools. Initially, the competition was literally a matter of life and death. Pythagoras, the triangle-theorem guy who lived around 500 BC in Greece, some 2500 years ago, was a successful teacher of his time. He was almost killed by a rival for a disagreement over the 'content' of the education he imparted. Socrates, another teacher, was executed for the same reason - his 'content' was unacceptable to other teachers and his own state.\n\nLuckily, such violence decreased over time and people needed other ways to compete. In competitive environments, violence (aka. war), is usually replaced with trade/business. Since teachers could no longer kill other teachers, they competed with their offerings - their content and their methods. Business flourished.\n\nWhat about the third part - Tech? The Tech is NOT new either. It's true that Pythagoras couldn't record a video to explain his theorem and stream it to children around the world, across time periods. He, however, could **write** to educate others. The 'Tech' in the Ed of his time was writing. But the tech of writing had a problem, it wasn't 'scalable'. \n\nPythagoras' writing couldn't reach many people, because, during his time, writing couldn't be easily replicated. The only way to copy a text was to copy it by hand. In addition, people who could write were rare, and therefore the whole process became costly. If you were an upper-class Greek living in Pythagoras' time, affording a book would be uneconomical. If you were a class below that, an impossibility.\n\nLet's say, somehow you could find 1000 customers to buy a book, you wouldn't be able to find so many copiers to copy the book by hand. The system of producing books broke down as the size of the production increased.\n\nIn all, Pythagoras' words couldn't travel far. But, that changed with the invention of printing.\n\n![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F82c4b75a-659d-41ef-ac86-d0d530bceddc_1125x1500.jpeg)\n\nAround the year 1440, almost 2000 years after Pythagoras, a German named Gutenberg invented the printing press. Now, one could write a book, send it to the press and get copies made. In Startup-speak, the printing press made writing 'scalable'.\n\nAs one 'scaled' -- Startup-Speak for 'increased the size' -- of the whole operation of printing books, the system wouldn't break. For example, if a customer wanted 1000 copies of a book, Gutenberg could create a whole workshop with multiple presses. If Gutenberg wouldn't, someone else who saw an opportunity would. By the year 1500, 60 years later, there were at least 1000 print shops in the world. Before the year 1440, the total number of printed books in the world was in the thousands. 60 years later, this number was 20 million i.e. 2 crore. This level of scalability was unprecedented, but that wasn't all.\n\nThe core innovation behind the printing press invented by Gutenberg was 'the movable type'. The whole press was essentially a giant rectangular stamp fitted with 'metal letters' - called type - that could be moved around and swapped in and out. Printing with it had some initial time investment - one had to carefully arrange letters to be printed on each page - letter by letter, word by word, line by line, one punctuation mark at a time. But, once you had arranged the letters for a page you could print that page, any number of times. It did not matter if you printed 1 copy or 100 copies of that page.\n\n![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff298a9e0-50d0-4362-b668-5b9ca8ca5d69_1488x989.jpeg)\n\nLet's say you had to print 100 copies of a page. The work required to set the letters to print one page was greater than the work required to write one page by hand. But printing the next 99 copies was much much faster, and cheaper - ink, stamp, repeat.\n\nThis meant that the per-book printing cost became cheaper and cheaper as one printed more and more copies of a book. The printing wasn't just scalable, it became cheaper as the size of the whole operation increased. In Startup-speak, printing gave writing 'the economies of scale'.\n\nCheaper books meant, more people could buy them and therefore more people could read them. When more people read books, they educated themselves more. Ideas spread, thinking changed, behaviors soon followed and groundbreaking discoveries were made.\n\nIf you define an Ed-Tech Revolution as Tech revolutionizing Education, then it is safe to say that - the \"Tech\" of the printing press, revolutionized education 5 centuries ago, in what can be called the first Ed-Tech revolution - The Renaissance.\n\n### The Second Ed-Tech Revolution\n\nOn D-day, in that hostel, 500 years after the printing press, when we were furiously punching those laptop keys, we were doing something very similar to Gutenberg. We were just like one of the printing houses but in the second Ed-tech revolution. Our printing press, our tech, was ' internet + computers'. History doesn't repeat, it rhymes.\n\nSo, why convert the doc into gibberish? Once the content on our doc was converted to gibberish - the code - it could to uploaded to a server - our website/app - through the internet. Once that was done, anyone around the world with a computer could go to our website, log in and instantaneously access a copy of the content we made. The tech made our content scalable and since making more copies cost almost no money, it had economies of scale. Adding 1000 teachers, no problem. Adding 1 million new students, no problem. Any press, even today, would break if asked for a million copies in a day, but our tech wouldn't. The scalability of this tech was boundless. But essentially, all we were doing that morning was arranging the letters and words so that cheap copies of the doc could be made, just like the press. \n\nOur copies were a bit different from the ones Gutenberg made - they weren't just cheap they were dirt-cheap, and they were way better. Also, the tech allowed us to customize, track, and monitor our copies. In principle, that is the promise of Ed-techs - to give children cheap access to personalized content, help them track their progress, and let their parents monitor this process. \n\n**D-day. 1230 hrs.** The conversion of the doc to code was done. The content was uploaded to the website and the notification was sent to the teacher. We were done an hour and a half before the deadline. We were happy. Finally, some sleep. Hubble and I crashed. \n\n**1530 hrs**, 30 minutes before the class.\n\n\"Wake up! Wake up! The teacher is calling,\" our founder yelled and kicked me at the same time to wake me up.\n\nI picked it up and she screamed, \"What have you guys sent me? I just saw it. I am NOT using this lesson for the class. We will talk later. In the evening.\" She hung up.\n\n.............**Shit! What now?**\n\n```\nSidenote: Found any errors? Let me know. Comment or Message.\n```\n\n> **Thanks for reading.**\n>\n> **A Like or a Share will go a long way :)**\n\n_**Extras:**_\n\nAll tech does, is decrease the time or effort required by humans to do something. In other words, it makes things easier. A human can do more with technology than without technology. If you think of money as just an imaginary standard to measure human time and effort, then any technology that makes things easier or faster will make things cheaper. When things get cheaper, more people can access them and when more people can access something, it fundamentally changes their behaviour. When the technology is innovative, the speed of this change in behaviour is unprecedented, and this unprecedented change is termed a revolution. \n\n_**Further Reading/Viewing**_\n\n**Video:** How a Gutenberg press works\n\n**Book:** The Gutenberg revolution by John Man\n","id":"f07f4ed8-dedf-40f6-aa8d-3894a4212190"},"16":{"slug":"ep-4-a-fellows-pilgrimage-summer","title":"Ep 4: A Fellow's Pilgrimage - Summer, Slums, & Startups","shortTitle":"Ep 4: A Fellow's Pilgrimage - Summer, Slums, & Startups","description":"","tags":"","heroImage":"","createdAt":"2021-07-19","content":"\n_This is Episode 4 of the series that I am writing to demystify Ed-tech for anyone outside the system._\n\n## Ep 4: A Fellow's Pilgrimage - Summer, Slums, & Startups\n\n## A Summer in Pune\n\n*On a mountain top, somewhere near Pune, Maharashtra.* \n\nAround 1:45 pm on a 'flaming' hot May afternoon, she got off the bus a second ago and now she's running towards the hostel mess for her lunch break. \"I have been up since 5:30 am\", she says \"First, I went to a school where I taught a class of 40, and now it's time for me to become a student and sit in a class of 40.\" She looks at her wristwatch. \"But, there is no time left. The lecture starts in 15 minutes and the mess is still 10 minutes away\". \n\nShe's almost at the door of the mess. \"I hope today they have Chinese. I'm fed up with the dal and chawal\". It was dal and chawal and yet, she inhaled it. It was all over in 5 minutes. \"Time to go to class.\" She looked at the timetable. \"Today's lecture is on Child Development. Hmm. And where?\" she moved her finger down the chart. \"Tagore hall? Where is that?\"\n\nShe will attend these lectures till 8:30 in the evening, like yesterday, the day before that, and the one before that. She will do the same tomorrow -- wake up at 5:30, go and teach in a school till 1:00, force-feed herself, and then attend the lectures till 8:30 in the evening -- and she will do it again the next day, and the one after that. She is one of many, almost 500, mostly in their twenties, on this one-month-long pilgrimage called the 'Summer School'. \n\n## Who was Pedagogy? What was Piaget?\n\n*Mumbai, D-day, 8:00 pm.* \n\nThe teacher finally called. \"What you sent me was not suitable for Grade 3 students. Who explains 'a genocide' to a third grader? And, that picture of the children crying near the rows of graves? It would be difficult for the children to sleep at night!\" she pointed out 10 more errors to go with that and then hung up after asking us to do better. \n\nI was the one who had made that plan. I was the one who acted like an idiot too. The chapter in the textbook had a short story from the [Rwandan genocide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rwandan_genocide) and I had to make an exciting lesson about it. First, I decided to explain the meaning of 'genocide' to grade 3 children. Then, I thought that it would be a great idea to include images and videos of the brutalities of the genocide to add some context and make the lesson more real for these grade 3 children. Two minutes of silence... for me and my logic. \n\nRemember I wondered what Piaget was? And if Pedagogy was a female scientist? Pedagogy was not a female scientist, it was a term. Pedagogy is a field of study that explains how to teach. If I had dug a bit deeper into any book on Pedagogy, in one of its subsections, I would have found a topic called Child Development. There I would have come across Piaget (pee·uh·zhay). A psychologist who devoted his whole life to understanding how children think and what they can understand at different stages of their lives. \n\n![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F17e18139-6206-454e-b75c-0b01a537d9a0_408x683.png)\n\nI wish I had dug deeper, as it would have stopped me from committing the obvious blunder of 'explaining a genocide to a 3rd grader brought up in South Delhi'. \n\nBut as I had explained before, there was no time to sleep, and therefore digging deeper is just one of those fantasies that I can have in retrospect. In reality, the drive to sleep is far more primal than the drive to be curious. So what we did was, we took her feedback, learned from our mistakes, and kept moving. \n\nBut, one thing was for certain, we couldn't keep on making such blunders or else there would be a lot of 'churn' -- Startup-speak for your customers giving up on you and leaving. We needed someone who knew something about the alchemy of education.\n\n## Summer to Slums\n\n![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9922aafd-76a5-4040-9e36-fd70bcc08887_1488x992.jpeg)\n\n_On a bus somewhere on the Pune-Mumbai expressway._\n\n\"The last month was crazy,\" she says as she is traveling back to Mumbai on a bus. \"You know, 6 months ago, I was sitting in a lecture hall in my college when these guys visited and said that they were looking for future leaders. People who would define the future of education. I was hesitant in the beginning, but then I said yes to the program.\" \n\n\"And before I knew it, I was on a bus with a bunch of unknowns on my way to the mountains to learn about education, to be a leader\" she continued as she reminisced, with a gleam in her eyes. \"I'm excited to bring myself to my classroom. I never imagined that I would be excited, going to teach in a government school located inside a slum for 2 whole years. But, things have changed.\"\n\n\"Also I am getting paid for it, 20K per month in fact. But, that doesn't matter much. All I want to do is help my children. Get them to be leaders. Get them to be the best version of themselves.\"\n\n> **Everybody has a plan until they get punched in the mouth. - Mike Tyson**\n\nIn the next two years, in that class, what she will experience will be beyond her wildest imagination - she would be shouted at by children; children will openly abuse her; one child will bring a dagger to the class and threaten another child; other teachers in the school will gang up and play politics against her, and she will feel like quitting at least once a week for the first few months. \n\nBut she won't. She will persevere, create hundreds of lesson plans, spend almost all of her salary on getting classroom supplies, and keep showing up to change the lives of those children. For those two years, those children will get an excellent education. Then, she will leave, with excellent lesson planning and teaching skills, a dream to be a leader, and a Whatsapp group full of children who call her 'didi'. \n\n![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd2d68a05-4dca-4599-bb2e-57ea374078d9_1488x992.jpeg)\n\n**Welcome to the wild wild world of 'Teach for India' aka TFI - a non-profit education organization.** TFI recruits people, puts them on a bus, takes them to a mountain, and trains them for a month, in what they believe, are the best practices in education and leadership. During this month, also known as 'summer school', the recruits, who are called 'fellows', spend half of their days learning about teaching and the other half applying those practices by teaching a class of children in a school nearby. \n\nAfter about a month, they leave for another city, where they have to teach in a government school, usually located in a slum, for 2 years, or optionally for 3. Why? TFI believes that this is the way to change education. TFI prides itself in 'creating leaders' and hopes that 'one day all children will attain an excellent education.'\n\nHowever, TFI could also pride itself in being the best prep school for Ed-techs. Why? There are two reasons I think. One, Ed-tech needs people who understand the alchemy of education - specifically lesson planning and teacher training. TFI fellows know more than a thing or two about that. \n\nTwo, TFI fellows are cheap to hire. Their stipend during the fellowship is 20K, most of which they end up spending on the children they teach. So, a 40-50K starting salary is a big jump for fellows and dirt cheap for startups. \n\nConsequently, a lot of TFI fellows end up joining Ed-techs. It is almost impossible to find a startup whose Ed team doesn't have a TFI fellow.\n\n> **...in this world nothing can be said to be certain, except death and taxes. -Benjamin Franklin**\n\nIn this **Ed-tech world**, nothing can be said to be certain, except death, taxes, and **TFI Fellows**.\n\n## Slums to Startups\n\nWhen we needed someone for our Ed-team, the path of least resistance was to hire someone from TFI. So, we did just that - hired a fellow from TFI, branded them as the 'Author' aka Content Developer, explained to them the product and we made lesson plans happily ever after...\n\nNo. Not really.\n\n_**3 months later**_\n\n\"**I don't think I can do this.** I did not sign up for this. I never get to see the children that I am making lesson plans for. I am not a lesson-planning machine. Are we really educating children or playing a game with them?\" she was in pain as she said these words. \n\n\"Also, what is this toxic culture? What's with glorifying people who work 24x7? Isn't there a thing called work-life balance?\"\n\n\"Why is everything about the costs and profits and efficiency and metrics?\"\n\n\"**Consider today to be the beginning of my notice period.**\" And, she left the room. \n\nAll of those were fair questions. They made sense. Why couldn't we do all the things that she said? **What went wrong?**\n\nYou see, if you are a for-profit Ed-tech startup, there is a duality to hiring someone from TFI. A duality that has been engineered into the TFI system......to be continued in the next episode.\n\n```\nFound any errors? Let me know.

Exciting chaos. Why? Because OpenAI launched a new way to generate images. First, I generated an image for my partner — she was awestruck, and I earned a ton of brownie points. Then I generated an image of my sister and sent it on the family group. That’s when all hell broke loose. I generated images non-stop until midnight.\n\nA week later, the rush is over. The wave has passed. I’m no longer the image support guy. So, let me reflect. OpenAI launched the model on 25th of March. They have done many launches before but this one hit the world different. People went mad, like my family, like almost every family who came in contact with 4o image generation. In a week 120M people generated more than 800M images.\n\nIt didn’t happen all at once. OpenAI began rolling out GPT-4o on May 13, 2024 — starting with text. Then came voice, and finally, after a 10-month wait, native image generation arrived on March 25, 2025.\n\n<GoDeep\n  title=\"native image generation\"\n  content=\"That means the 4o model can now generate images on its own; it no longer needs to call a separate model to generate images. OpenAI was not the first to launch native images, but they were the first to get it right. The same model can now do text, audio and images.\"\n/>\n\n## Ghiblify\n\nPeople went mad in one very specific way: the Ghibli way. In the demo, the OpenAI team showed that you could upload a picture of yours and ask the model to \"Ghiblify\" it, ie, make it in the style of a popular anime studio - Studio Ghibli.\n\nHere is the style of the studio.\n\n<ImageX\n  src={\"ghiblification/totoro\"}\n  alt=\"Totoro movie poster.\"\n  variant=\"landscape\"\n/>\n\nHere’s what it generated when I gave it a photo of me falling off a chair.\n\n<ImageX\n  src={\"ghiblification/fall-ghibli\"}\n  alt=\"4o Image Generation Preview\"\n  variant=\"landscape\"\n/>\n\nHere is another one, this time in a different style, but equally good.\n\n<ImageX\n  src={\"ghiblification/sleep\"}\n  alt=\"4o Image Generation Preview\"\n  variant=\"landscape\"\n/>\n\n## Flood\n\nInstagram, X, LinkedIn — everything was flooded. People were sharing moments they’d normally keep private. A quiet dinner. A blurry fall. A sleepy baby. Why? Because Ghiblified images feel real enough to connect... but not real enough to expose. That’s new.\n\n## Subscriptions\n\nIn India, people don't pay for subscriptions. But they are paying for this. In fact, this was the first time anyone in my family asked me about the price of a subscription — and I’ve been their tech support guy for over a decade. OpenAI said that India was their fastest growing market now. This is bonkers. Insane. The subscription is $20 plus taxes in India and people are still paying for it — \"The most recent Household Consumption Expenditure Survey for 2022-23 shows the average monthly per capita consumption expenditure across all goods and services was around ₹2,000-5000 in rural India and ₹3,500-6400 in urban India.\" So paying ₹2300 for one subscription is INSANE.\n\n## Predictions\n\nGhiblification is just one aspect of 4o, it can also generate flawless text, has spacial awareness and can handle multiple elements in one image. You can control resolution, size, colors, aspect ratio. It can make almost everything that Canva can, and it can do it in 1% of the time and maybe 10% of the effort. You don't have pixel level control but for everything where good-enough suffices, this will replace your Canva use. Think: educational content, flyers, product posts — anything where “good enough” beats “perfect.” What blows my mind is that this is just version one. If this gets better at the same rate as the text models, you might never need to open a design tool again. Just describe how it should feel. Vibe designing.\n","id":"918e36fe-b6e7-4e92-b133-5eed5db59841"},"18":{"slug":"gpt-45-bro","title":"GPT 4.5bro","shortTitle":"GPT 4.5bro","description":"","tags":"","heroImage":"","createdAt":"2025-03-01T00:00:00.000Z","content":"I remember when OpenAI launched GPT-4o.

'Following the passion' is the desired life for many. We keep romanticizing about 'following the passion', dreaming about it, thinking about it. **Yet, time passes, and we never go on the path of following our passion.**\n\nThe belief is this - if I am passionate about something, I will enjoy doing it, and I will never get bored. I will jump out of bed, instead of snoozing that alarm. I will be on time, for all meetings, and for all commitments. I will need no motivation. We believe that one day, we will live the dream. **Yet, more time passes, and we never follow our passion.**\n\nTo further quench our obsession, we read books about 'following the passion', we listen to podcasts to get motivated, and we profess to our friends how 'One day, I will follow my passion.' **Yet, we don't do it, and time keeps on passing.**\n\nWe keep building their theories and fantasies about 'the path of passion', without ever testing them out in the real world. And if there is one thing that almost all humanity agrees on, it is this: \"building theories without testing, and then applying it to the real world, leads to disaster\". Here are a few absurd theories about following the 'path of passion', that I have found, through my own experience, to be particularly disastrous:\n\n## Following the passion = Work becomes easy\n\nPassion does not make your work easy. I will give you an example. I am passionate about history, any history. Initially, I fantasized, 'only if I got the time to read history for a week straight, what a dream would that be!'.\n\nThen, one day it happened, I got a week in which I have no commitments, no work, and decided to dedicate it to reading history. That was a reality check. My brain just refused to process it after reading a few pages. There were multiple characters to keep track of, multiple timelines to follow, and cause-and-effect chains that were so long that it was impossible for me to keep them in mind. The books kept citing events I had never heard of and when I googled those events, they pointed to more events, and so on. The myth of following the passion, being 'a dream' started crumbling. Reading history was hard, and when I got to a certain depth, very very hard. The same happened when my passion led me to explore complex systems, probability, sales, venture capital, and even rapping. Passion does not do the actual work for you.\n\nPassion gives us the start, but it does not do the work for us, nor does it make the work easy. Everything that we are passionate about, becomes difficult when you get deeper into it and that is just how it works. The idea that passion makes our work easy is a gross oversimplification of what it actually does. Passion makes the work easier because we are motivated, but it does NOT make it fundamentally easy.\n\nDoing the work requires 'doing the work'. Passion alone is not enough!\n\n## Passion = Constant Motivation\n\nAnother flawed theory is that if we are passionate about something, we will constantly be motivated to do it. I have experienced this to be false too.\n\nSometimes, I just want to burn the books that I am reading and just go hide somewhere. Sometimes I don't want to make a sale even for the product that I am passionate about. Sometimes I don't want to write, even though I know I love doing it. Passion is not some arc reactor of constant motivation embedded in you.\n\n![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc9b9fb33-ab63-48e0-9f65-5f1390642d70_1488x837.jpeg)\n\nAlong with passion, we require patience and purpose. Patience for the days when we don't feel the passion. Patience to keep the focus on the purpose on the days when passion is absent. Passion alone is not enough!\n\n## Passion = Change in Habits\n\n\"I will jump out of bed, instead of snoozing that alarm. I will be on time, for all meetings, for all commitments.\" No, you won't.\n\nPassion may change a lot of things for our basic behaviour and impulses remain. Passion might act as a catalyst if we want to change these habits but this change will not be spontaneous. It will be slow and it will take active work.\n\nThe habit-controlling centre lies in the part of the brain that is sometimes called the 'monkey brain' to explain its functions. Thinking that following your passions, will change your habits, is like saying, giving a monkey banana will suddenly change its basic monkey behaviour.\n\n![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F09973a29-604d-458a-aaae-298a66f8f649_1488x986.jpeg)\n\nSo, if you had a job that you weren't passionate about and were consistently late for work, you will probably be late for work, even after you find a job you're passionate about. In the initial days, you might be able to control those behaviours but you will soon drift into the old habits.\n\n\"I will wake up at 5:00 am, if I could follow my passion\", not gonna happen.\n\n\"I will work for 16 hours a day\", not going to happen.\n\n\"I will stop lying about not being in office\", not gonna happen.\n\nChanging behaviour requires active work, passion alone is not enough!\n\n## Passion & Rationality\n\nPassion may not be rational, that is its biggest weakness and that is its super-power.\n\nIf we are always rational while pursuing something we are passionate about, we might never be able to understand our true limits. Being passionate about 'Saving the civilization' is irrational, yet Musk is doing it. Being passionate about 'fighting poverty, disease, and inequity around the world' is irrational, yet Gates is doing it. Most passions that lead to game-changing solutions are by definition irrational, hence the word game-changing.\n\nPassions don't always have to be game-changing at the world level, like the examples I gave. If they change the game for you at a personal level, they might redefine the meaning of rationality for you. Being passionate about 'becoming a singer' is irrational only until you become one. As Mandela said, \"It always seems impossible until it is done\".\n\nBut as I said, there is a dichotomy, the irrationality of passion is also its weakness. When you keep clinging to passion or when you keep taking fatal risks, passion might give you results that you don't want. All stories about passion don't end well. A passion that is out of touch with reality is one of the constantly occurring human tragedies. Here is a list of '[free solo' climbers](https://www.climbernews.com/free-soloists-the-climbers-who-risk-it-all/), all of them passionate about climbing peaks without ropes, all of them great, and most of them dead. As time passes, the risk accrues and disaster strikes.\n\n![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe1950cd4-d352-432f-8bd7-34605056ee24_1488x992.jpeg)\n\n**Passion is not a magic bullet that will solve all your problems. It is a 'very sharp' double-edged sword that must be wielded with extreme care while respecting its limitations.**\n","id":"32db1d1c-5700-4869-99f0-eb8ed427661f"},"21":{"slug":"hungry-depressed-broke-people-for","title":"Hungry, Depressed, Broke People for Sale","shortTitle":"Hungry, Depressed, Broke People for Sale","description":"","tags":"","heroImage":"","createdAt":"2022-07-07","content":"\n### This is about the years 1929-1939, the era termed \"The Great Depression\".

My metric of success for this article is _F-words/minute_. **If you end up saying the F-word a lot of times while reading this, I would consider my job done.**\n\n## Economic Armageddon\n\nIf you don't know anything about this time, I would want you to skip the details for now and just read on with one premise - somehow the world came face to face with economic Armageddon. Everything that can go wrong with the economy, went wrong with the economy - the stock market crashed, the real estate market crashed, the food prices crashed, banks closed, thousands of businesses went bankrupt, the money disappeared from the market, people ran out of food, etc. With that out of the way, let's begin.\n\n## **Your Savings Aren't Safe**\n\nImagine you wake up one day and use your phone to pay for groceries and the payment doesn't go through. You call the bank and they tell you that the bank is closed indefinitely and your access to your own savings is revoked.\n\nThey tell you that your money is safe and you can withdraw it when the bank reopens. This is a common tactic banks protect themselves from failing completely - they limit/close your ability to deposit or withdraw money. During this time of closure if the bank is able to recover (or saved by the government), it opens again, or else it fails and everyone loses everything.\n\nBank closure/failure is rare, but it happens. A total of 511 banks have failed in America in the last 13 years, out of which, only 8 have failed in the last 5 years. Around 400 failed during the first few years 2009 economic crisis - the worst crisis the world has seen in recent times.\n\n**During the Great Depression, around 9000 banks completely failed and almost ALL of them were closed for deposits or withdrawals business during the peak of depression.**\n\n![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9d0e906d-ed95-4278-ae83-5dd47d3cf0d8_1076x733.png)\n\nWhen banks closed millions of people instantly lost access to their life’s savings. And in the case they failed, they completely lost all their savings.\n\n## The Cycle Of Doom\n\nWhat happens when a well-known bank fails? How do people react?\n\nWhat would you do if the State Bank of India closes/fails tomorrow? What if your relative who had 100,000 in the account was locked out of their account? What if HDFC closes the next day and then HSBC?\n\nIf you are lucky and still have money in a different bank, you would probably run to withdraw your money. And so would all the other people whose banks haven't closed yet. This would put a bank in a situation where almost all of its depositors want their money out at the same time. **This is called a bank run.**\n\n![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F68d95f31-a6be-4a5e-94fe-998d1e38ee4c_901x720.jpeg)\n\nThe problem is this - banks don't have all your money with them at all times. When you deposit money, they give that money out as loans and charge a high interest on the loans. A part of this interest is given to you as interest on your deposit. That is how banks make a profit.\n\nOnly a part of the money is kept with the bank in the form of cash so that they can handle day-to-day withdrawals. A core assumption of this business model is - in normal circumstances, everyone will NOT ask for their money at the same time.\n\nBut when people have a slight hint of news about the bank or the economy failing, they run for their money, and then if the condition of the bank, gets too worse, it either closes or fails.\n\n## Take Note, or Shells, or Wood\n\n**I repeat, 9000 banks failed during the great depression.** When banks fail, people lose their savings, they can no longer get loans, and the checks are no longer accepted at businesses. And the ones that don't fail, stop the depositors from withdrawing money, fearing a bank run. When people can't withdraw physical money, the people who get their hands on physical money, start hoarding money and soon no one has any physical money to transact on a day-to-day basis.\n\n![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F22270971-5110-416e-96a4-7bdf7a9e9dfe_659x439.jpeg)\n\nDuring the depression, almost all of the physical money dried up. So people started using pieces of paper to trade goods with each other. These were called scrips. People went from bank notes to literal 'notes' written on a piece of paper. Sometimes even going to the extent of using shells, wood pieces, and metal tokens as a replacement for money.\n\n## So LOANly\n\nDuring good economic times, businesses are booming, the incomes of people in such businesses are high, and their morale is even higher. Loans are easy to get for individuals and they invest in pricier assets and bigger houses. During such times, paying back a loan seems easy. In the best case, people have enough income to pay back the loan themselves. In the worst case, the houses are rented out and the rent is used to pay back the loan. When people realize how easy it is to get houses and pay back the loan, they get more houses on loans and call it an investment. This was the case in the early 1920s in America.\n\nDuring bad times, businesses don't make money because people have no money to spend, therefore businesses shrink or shut down. When this happens people lose jobs, and the money dries up. They can't pay their rent or the loan installments. Soon, their houses are taken over by banks and then auctioned off to recover the money. This was the case in the early 1930s in America. Then it got worse.\n\nSoon, when banks auctioned seized assets, no one bid for them, as no one had the money, even at dirt-cheap prices. The banks were now left with assets that had no market value. Thousands and thousands of houses and other assets of no value at all. There came a point where the banks just stopped seizing assets as they knew it was of no value and just played the waiting game.\n\n## Passbooks for Sale\n\nWhen banks closed, people also started selling their bank passbooks at discounted prices. 40 - 80 dollars for every 100 dollars of saving depending on the bank in which you had the account. Passbook prices were routinely published in the newspapers. People who had the cash, bought these discounted passbooks and then used the money in the accounts to pay back their loans to the bank or buy seized properties that the banks auctioned.\n\n## Buffetology\n\nWarren Buffett has a simple investment philosophy - if you have hard cash when others don't, you can invest it in assets with low prices, and get rich in the long term when prices get back to normal. Buffetology states that - if you are rich during a downturn, you will be much richer after it.\n\nMost people who happened to have hard cash in the great depression did not plan for the depression but they were the luckiest people during that time. Since no one else had the cash, they could buy houses, land, stocks, bonds, loans, etc. at prices that were way below the actual value of these assets. In short, the rich got richer.\n\n## I am For Sale\n\nSince people had no money, they started cutting down on expenses. The demand fell and almost everything got cheaper. As people spent less and less, the prices kept crashing. There came a point where the prices went so low that it was cheaper for the farmers to destroy their produce than to take it to the market to sell it.\n\n![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F24815206-27f7-44ce-bda0-2125a490ca58_1200x865.png)\n\nIronically, the food was still not cheap enough for people to buy. I repeat, people had no money. So on one side, farmers were destroying food and on the other people were dying from hunger.\n\n![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F22e2cfb1-f789-4878-ae45-12319937db4b_1188x1500.jpeg)\n\nMost people depended on charity for food. They formed long lines in front of soup kitchens for a bowl of soup and a loaf of stale bread. It became very common for every house to have a vegetable garden. Even the people who lived in big houses did not have the money to buy food. Some went begging door to door. Those who still couldn't get food migrated back to villages in hope of at least being able to grow food and eat.\n\n![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F28cef760-a027-4560-be5d-78ff44b4e007_885x720.jpeg)\n\n**At the very height of the depression, people were advertising to sell themselves or marry for money**.\n\n## Proudly Broke\n\n![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F57b6a82b-6d10-4340-95f6-98d2e28f4af8_879x662.jpeg)\n\nThere came a point in the depression where people just accepted the fact that they were broke. They bragged about how broke they were to each other. Going bankrupt or losing a house no longer affected them. They shared stories of their ruin and unemployment with each other and compared notes on how much they lost in the crash.\n\n## Other Signs of the Time\n\nTo conclude, here is a list of other things that happened that need no explanation:\n\n- All theaters/clubs were closed.\n- Small businesses had constant sales, but there were no customers. Soon they ran out of money and closed.\n- People stopped caring about non-lethal medical issues like dental care. They stopped buying new clothes, shoes, or anything non-essential. Those who smoked started rolling their own cigarettes.\n- School teachers did not get paid.\n- College graduates did not get jobs after college.\n- The only lawyers that made money were in the business of handling the closing of businesses.\n- People started trading their insurance policies for food.\n- People rioted in factories after being laid off.\n- Insanity and suicide were common among rich businessmen who lost it all.\n\n```\nNote: This is Draft No. 1.

This is what I know as of 4:00 pm on May 7.\n\nAt 7 am, I woke up to a message from my mom: \"Bahut firing ho rahi hai.\" I slept at 10:00 pm, so I had no idea about what she was talking about. I opened Twitter and saw that people were posting about artillery shelling in Poonch city. My family lives in the city. I called my mom. She said they had taken shelter in the safest room possible.\n\nThis is the full timeline of what happened. Around 50 of my family, friends, and close relatives live in the city. Ours is a joint family, so there are four nuclear families that live in the same family house. I will try to do justice to what they've described.\n\n### May 1–5\n\nPeople smell something is off. Some say that the vibe has all the signals of war. Artillery guns deployed. Bunkers cleaned. Schools closed. Government assigns schools in the city to villagers living at the border - they can use the schools for shelter if their villages get hit by shells. It also asks the hospital staff to stay ready.\n\nPeople in my family start discussing what to do if an all-out war breaks. Some people in my neighborhood start hoarding groceries, cash and other essentials.\n\n### May 6\n\nPoonch administration makes an announcement - schools will stay closed on the 7th. This is never a good sign. People get the signal. They start rushing to ATMs and grocery shops. The ATMs run out of cash. The grocery shops stay open till late night. There was nothing \"mock\" about this drill. By the afternoon, my family starts stocking up on groceries and filling water tanks. They cancel all plans for vacations or picnics.\n\nMy family is the last one to panic, and them doing this makes me anxious. On our family chat group, people keep sharing clips related to upcoming war and rising tensions. I refuse to believe them, asking them to calm down, telling them these tensions would soon be over.\n\n### May 7\n\nAt 12:30 am my family starts hearing the first shells. The shells drop 3-5 kilometers away from the city. A couple of my family members go to the terrace to see what is happening. One shell whizzes over their head, throwing them into a panic. The shell falls 5 kilometers away but strongly signals that the situation is going to get worse - if it can go over them, it can hit them. Everyone wakes up. People stay in their respective rooms, cautious about the situation but still not too worried as sounds come from afar.\n\nAt around 5:00 am, a shell hits our family house. It hits the water tank on the top floor, destroying the tank and the stairs to the top floor. It fills up the whole house with dust and smoke. Windows shatter. People scream and yell for help. At the time, they have no idea where the shell hit, but they know it hit the house.\n\nThe shelling intensifies, peaking at around 6:00 am. My family and neighbors shift to the safest room in the house, many sobbing, all scared. A piece of shrapnel hits the other water tank in our house, and it starts leaking. Water everywhere. Shells hit schools, colleges, bus stations, cars, houses.\n\nAt 7:00 am I receive the first message from my mother. I call her. She cracks a joke but I hear fear in her voice. She describes the scene and tells me about what had transpired. She says 30 people are dead in the city, hundreds injured, and there's panic at the hospital. I check social media. I see the level of devastation. Videos made by my friends and family flood my WhatsApp. By this time a shell has dropped in a 10-meter radius of three of our relatives' houses.\n\nAt 9:00 am, shelling starts to slow down. People start talking about leaving Poonch. Some families from our neighborhood pack their bags and leave. While leaving, they plead with our family to leave too. Buses overflow. Hundreds of the migrant workers evacuate the city on foot, hoping to catch a bus from the next city. People leave on whatever transport they can find.\n\nBy 10:00 am, more videos flood my inbox. More calls. More worried messages. First details of people who died emerge; in it, is a person we all know. The shelling dies down. People start talking rationally. Thousands more leave the city. One of the nuclear families in the family house decides to leave Poonch. The rest of them are still there. The elders in the family ask the women and children to move to a safer city. They refuse to go.\n\nBy 12:00 pm the news of the shelling makes it to national media channels. But the level of destruction is not made public. That changes in the following hours - Ten dead and forty injured, hundreds of houses damaged, vehicles hit. An old teacher of mine tells us that two students from my school are dead.\n\nAt 2:00 pm, shells hit an ambulance and a car traveling to Jammu. Everyone in the ambulance dies. A woman loses her hand, and her child dies in the car. We know this woman, she was evacuating her family to safety. People are now rethinking the move. Some still take the leap.\n\n## What now?\n\nI am writing this at around 3 pm and hope to publish it by 4:00. At this time, people in my family just want to sleep. They have a hunch that they won't be able to sleep after 7:00 pm tonight. They have been awake for well over 24 hours and are expecting more sleepless nights.\n\nSome of them are discussing moving to Jammu or other safer areas but they want to wait for a couple of days before they make the decision. Some of them say that they won't leave until they get a directive from the army, while others say they would leave if the situation normalizes a bit.\n\nThey have already set up the kitchen in the basement and are filling up sacks of sand to line the terrace. They are also stocking up more supplies.\n\nI will write the next one, same time tomorrow.\n\n---\n\n# Warning: Graphic Content\n\n### Destruction\n\nThis shop is 50 meters from our house.\n\n<Facebook href=\"https://www.facebook.com/photo/?fbid=1129118072575449&set=pcb.1129118332575423\" />\n\n### Shelling and Migration\n\nLook for three things in this video.

This is what I know as of 4:00 pm on May 9._\n\n_Read [Poonch Shelling - Day One](https://www.ashant.in/blog/poonch-one) for context._\n\n---\n\nOn the 8th of May, at 9:30 am, my mom calls. She says some elders in the family are refusing to leave Poonch. \"me kya karoon? Akeli nikal jaaun?\" She wants to get to Jammu, to safety.\n\nThis is the story of her journey.\n\n## May 7: Prelude\n\nShelling devastates the city of Poonch on the morning of the 7th. It stops at 12:00 pm. 15 dead, 50 injured.\n\nMy uncle switches on the news to see how the world has reacted. They haven't. He asks why? No one has answers. We look for local sources for news. A video shows a local news reporter – he turns on his selfie camera. A shell hits a house and a stream of blood gushes out. He keeps reporting as shells fall in the background. He pleads: \"Please leave the city. Please leave Poonch.\"\n\nThousands leave. The road from Poonch to Surankote, a town 20 kilometers towards Jammu, is full of people - on foot, on bikes, in cars, trucks, or anything they could find. People do not want to spend the night in Poonch.\n\nThroughout the evening, my family contemplates leaving Poonch. But they have shops, houses, friends. The discussion gets heated. They don’t want to leave everything behind. My uncle cleans his double‑barrel rifle.\n\nMy sister and I are looking for cabs to get our mom to safety. But everyone who could leave Poonch has already left. Poonch is a ghost town. Cabs are impossible to find. The day ends.\n\n## May 8: The Journey\n\nI wake up at 7:00 am. I get the news that nothing happened between 12:00 and 7:00 am. The family groups have no new messages. Relief.\n\nAt 9:30 am, my mom calls. She says some elders in the family are refusing to leave Poonch. \"me kya karoon? Akeli nikal jaaun?\"\n\nThe family sits together at 10:00 am. They make a decision to leave. Next challenge is to find a cab. They convince a driver, who even with his family and children at home, decides to help.\n\n---\n\nDestination — Jammu. Departure time – 3:00 pm. Estimated arrival – 11:00 pm. Distance – 260 km.\n\n<ImageX src=\"poonch-two/loc\" variant=\"square\" alt=\"A map of the LOC\" />\n\nThe dark red line is the International Border, hereafter IB. The dotted line to the left of it is the Line of Control, the de facto border, hereafter the border. They have to go from the red circle to the green one. The pinkish line connecting the two is the way.\n\nIf they encounter shelling on the way, we have 4 possible shelters - Friends and family live in Surankote (20 km), Rajouri (80 km), Naushera (120 km), Sundarbani (150 km).\n\n[Route Map](https://maps.app.goo.gl/dC4BfaGWDNP7wwqz8)\n\n---\n\nAt **3:00 pm** they leave Poonch. My cousin is in the car. She shares her location with me. She shares videos. I can see relief on their faces. Bright sunshine. No shelling or gunfire in the background. Our dog is jumping from lap to lap.\n\nAt **4:00 pm** they cross Surankote. Now they are out of the range of direct shelling.\n\nAt 6:00 pm, they cross Rajouri.\n\nAt 7:30 pm they cross Naushera. At 8:10, I check the location again. Same as 40 minutes ago. I call. They are having food. My cousin says they are out of danger, they are taking a break. They notice a moving red light in the sky. They ignore it.\n\nAt 8:11 pm, I receive a message from my sister in Jammu, \"Bomb Bomb Siren\".\n\nI look on Twitter. Drones are flying over Jammu city. Swarms of red lights in the sky. Complete blackout in the city. Sirens everywhere. Gunfire. Artillery fire. This has NEVER happened in Jammu before.\n\nMy sister: \"Loud bombs, University area, we are in the basement.\" She continues, \"I have asked mom to reach Sundarbani and take shelter.\"\n\nMy family gets back in the car and moves towards Sundarbani, 30 kilometers away. Army stops them and asks them to head back. They decide to go back to Naushera. My mom was a teacher for 10 years, and her colleague, who is now a Principal in Naushera, gives them shelter for the night. They are on the first floor of a three‑story school building. Panicked, they contemplate going back to Poonch, where, at least, they have a home.\n\nAt 9:00 pm, I call my sister, but she doesn’t pick up. Army has jammed the phone networks. People are unable to receive calls. WhatsApp still works, so I get in touch. Red lights continue to rule the sky. Some people call them drones, some missiles, some planes. Constant booms and sirens.\n\nSome say the defence airport is under attack, some say it's the university and some say the cantonment. People see red lights in Sundarbani, Naushera, Akhnoor (closest point to IB) and Pathankot. Heavy shelling in all the border areas near Jammu. All these areas on high alert with complete blackout.\n\nAt 11:00 pm, I call my mom. No shelling in Naushera area. No drone activity. Complete silence. They are safe. They are still thinking about going back to Poonch. Not for long.\n\n## May 9: Poonch, a city that was\n\nBy 12:00 am, my relatives in Poonch tell me that shelling has started at the border. They say - windows are shaking but nothing in the city yet. Not as bad as yesterday.\n\nThat changes at 12:06 am. A relative who is in Poonch messages in the group \"Shelling in the city now.\"\n\nAll hell breaks loose.\n\nHere are the messages we receive from different people.\n\n00:59\n\n> A lot more than yesterday. Main chowk, restaurants, schools, everything hit. A shell has fallen right next to your house. Shops near your house are destroyed. Residents saying, aaj Poonch city nahi bachega.\n\n01:08\n\n> Rockets are hitting us. A lot of them.\n\n01:15\n\n> They are saying it has hit your school - Christ School. Thank God, your family has left Poonch.\n\n01:33\n\n> I'm scared. I don't know if I will make it to sunrise.\n\n03:09\n\n> Sab khatam ho gaya idhar. Praying and praying. Will leave tomorrow. Rockets hain, sirf shells nahi.\n\n03:16\n\n> Bombs are hitting our veranda. 4–5 have hit the bazaar. Old Poonch, villages, city, everything hit.\n\n04:44\n\n> Missiles are hitting us. Poonch khatam hai.\n\n04:51\n\n> City khatam ho gayi hai. Bahut buri halat hai. Kam se kam 500 bombs.\n\nA tweet by someone on the ground sums up everything\n\n> Poonch was a city\n\n## Sunrise\n\nIn Poonch, the shelling stops at first light, around 5:00 am. All the friends and family in Poonch make it to the sunrise. Terrified, shook, but alive.\n\nIn Jammu, the first blackout ends at 11:00 pm. People go back to their rooms. At 04:35 am, they hear another siren. Another blackout. They move to the basements. They hear a couple of booms. This does not last long. They go back to their rooms after an hour. Final blackout for the night. Sunrise.\n\nMy family leaves Naushera at 8:00 am and reach Jammu at 11:00 am. The rest of the journey is uneventful. Here is our dog after the journey, as exhausted as its humans.\n\n<ImageX src=\"poonch-two/brownie\" variant=\"landscape\" alt=\"A resting dog.\" />\n\n## What now?\n\nThe journey that should have taken 8 hours took 20, but everyone made it. We have no idea if a shell hit our house, or our store. We don't know if any of our friends got hit. We don't know if anyone died in the city. We don't know if the situation will get better. Or, when it will get better. My family left Poonch to find safety in Jammu. How safe will Jammu be tonight, we don't know.\n\nMy mom says it doesn't matter. I think the same.\n\n---\n\n# Visuals\n\n### Local News Report\n\nA local news report from Poonch, showing the destruction from last night.\n\n<Youtube href=\"https://youtu.be/-Aza5iTIWx8?si=xw9x9UPddH8kjobj\" />\n\n### Destroyed Houses\n\n<Instagram href=\"https://www.instagram.com/reel/DJZQyiNT2th\" />\n\n<Instagram href=\"https://www.instagram.com/reel/DJa-CiWTQK1/\" />\n\n### Shelter\n\nPeople taking shelter in the district hospital.

They are simple diaries written during extraordinary times. The former, as is clear from the name, was written during the Great Depression of 1929–35, and the latter during the Second World War. I like how even the most ordinary of information from extraordinary times becomes extraordinary in retrospect. I intend to replicate these books in spirit.\n\nI believe we are currently living in an extraordinary time. There is no war, there is no depression (yet), but what has happened in AI in the last two years has been a sight to see. Which side am I on? I honestly don't know – I am not a maximalist, and neither am I a doomer.

Why? There are four primary reasons - bad flow, bad visuals, bad content, and bad presenters. This post is about bad visuals. Specifically - how bad visuals can ruin a presentation with great flow, great content, and a great presenter. If that is relevant to you, read on.\n\n## How humans process language\n\nI want you to play the audio of your choice in the background before you start reading the rest of this post. So, minimize this, open a music or podcast app and play something that you haven't heard before. Something interesting. Something that has words. Instrumentals don't count, anything with words does. Play it and get back to the article once you are ready.\n\n**You are still here? Trust me. Do it... Play it now.**\n\nNow that the audio is playing, read the following three bullet points. You can stop the audio once you are done reading the bullet points.\n\n- **Humans have only one language processing unit and this unit can process only one language string at a time.**\n- **That is, at this very moment, you can either comprehend the words in the audio or you can comprehend these words in these sentences. You can't do both at once.**\n- **When you comprehend the words in audio, the words in these sentences fade into the background. When you comprehend the words in these sentences, the words in the audio fade into the background.**\n\n_\\--You can stop the audio now.--_\n\nOne out of these three things has happened.\n\n1.  You have completely comprehended the three points, or\n2.  You have completely comprehended the audio, or\n3.  you have completely comprehended none of them.\n\nMost likely, you belong to the third category. You remember bits and pieces of both and you feel like you should read the bullet points again. Here are the there points again. This time pay complete attention:\n\n- **Humans have only one language processing unit and this unit can process only one language string at a time.**\n- **That is, at this very moment, you can either comprehend the words in the audio or you can comprehend these words in these sentences. You can't do both at once.**\n- **When you comprehend the words in audio, the words in these sentences fade into the background. When you comprehend the words in these sentences, the words in the audio fade into the background.**\n\n## Why Presentations Go Wrong\n\nThis is why a lot of presentations go wrong. There are too many things happening at the same time. When you use a lot of words in the presentation and elaborate on them while presenting, you are asking your audience to process two language strings at the same time. The human mind is incapable of this.\n\nIf you are expecting your audience to read what's on screen, they won't listen to you and if you are expecting your audience to listen to you, they won't read what's on the screen. The worst of all - they would hear you for a while, read a line on the screen, hear you again, read again, and will end up missing out on a lot of information. They won't admit that they have missed something or that they are utterly confused, but they will be. Just like you were with the audio playing in the background.\n\n## But...\n\nI can hear you saying, \"But, the words in the audio that I played and the words that I read are completely unrelated. It won't be like that on my presentation. The words on my presentation and the words that I speak will be related. It will work out. My wordy presentation will be great.\"\n\nI am sorry to break your heart, but it won't be. Again, just one language string at a time. Your brain might be more efficient in processing two related strings one after the other, but it will still process one string at a time. So, your audience will still hop back and forth between two strings and lose vital information as a result.\n\nI can also hear you saying \"But, sometimes the content matter is just too much. I have to write paragraphs on the slide. I just have to.\"\n\nYou can paraphrase the paragraph. You can just choose to add critical ideas to the slides. Here is a less wordy version of the bullet points that you read earlier. You can say everything else instead of writing it on the slides.\n\n- **Human brains can process JUST ONE language string at a time.**\n\nOr, you can do even better and show the audience instead of telling them. You can help them visualize the idea by adding visuals to your slides and offering the details as a commentary. You can do that by showing them a slide like -\n\n![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffd43d75f-751a-482a-9bac-1d78fa429107_1920x1080.jpeg)\n\nThe text on the top of this slide can be read in just a few seconds. For the rest of the duration, the audience is completely yours. Even better, they have visuals to anchor and better understand your words. If, a picture says a thousand words, just let it do its job.\n\n\"But\" I can still hear you saying \"What if I just can't shorten the length of sentences on the screen? What if it was a definition? What if it was something legal in nature?\"\n\nIn those cases, give your audience the time to read what you are presenting. Time in which you are silent and they are reading. This can be at the beginning of the presentation or in the middle of it as you make your points. Just, make sure that either they are reading, or you are speaking.\n\n**If you still have another \"BUT\" coming my way, remember the principle - [one string at a time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_multitasking) - and act based on your best judgment. But, as a rule of thumb 'make your presentations less wordy.'**\n","id":"12e9e87b-df09-457b-a931-bf3b7cd03753"},"26":{"slug":"principles-of-writing","title":"Principles of Writing","shortTitle":"Principles of Writing","description":"","tags":"","heroImage":"","createdAt":"2020-07-15","content":"\n![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd23f4096-8e9c-48c6-8c71-184938b0591a_875x558.jpeg)\n\nGood writing is ‘[useful writing](http://www.paulgraham.com/useful.html)’.

Today, while on my learning journey, I realized something that has fundamentally changed my worldview about Product Management.\n\n**The realization is this - I am NOT fascinated with Product Management, I am fascinated with Prototype Management.**\n\nLet me explain. Maybe it changes your worldview too.\n\n### The Product Dilemma\n\nI was reading a product management book called Getting Real written by folks at Basecamp. The following paragraph from Chapter 7, seriously challenged my mental model of a Product Launch:\n\n“Launching something great that’s a little smaller in scope than planned is better than launching something mediocre and full of holes because you had to hit some magical time, budget, and scope window. Leave the magic to Houdini. You’ve got a real business to run and a real product to deliver.”\n\nWhy did it challenge my mental model, you might ask. I have always worked at a startup or at my own startup. And whatever I have read or learned about launching a product is in complete contradiction to what is written in this paragraph. **Pretty much all startup advice books or blogs agree on one thing - it is okay to ship an imperfect product.**\n\n![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F533c60bc-d8e3-42e0-b898-c4f690b4e516_2870x1912.jpeg)\n\nFor example, here is an excerpt from the essential advice the world’s best startup factory - YCombinator - gives to the founders:\n\nLaunch now\n\nDo things that don't scale\n\nFind the 90 / 10 solution\n\nI trust Basecamp folks for advice, and I trust YC folks for advice. So, their diametrically opposite views on what product to launch were something that made me uneasy. That made me rethink my mental model of a product.\n\n### Product v. Prototype\n\n‘Inspired’, a book written by Marty Cagan, was the first product book I read, and almost all my Product related mental models originate from it. I opened it again and there it was, the answer to my uneasiness, staring right at me. Here is the key excerpt:\n\nI always try hard to reserve the term product to describe the state at which we can run a business on it. Specifically, it is scalable and performant to the degree necessary. It has a strong suite of automated regression tests. It is instrumented to collect the necessary analytics. It has been internationalized and localized where appropriate. It is maintainable. It is consistent with the brand promise. And, most important, it is something the team can release with confidence.\n\n![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F048e8106-7b0b-49c3-972f-c7ea8b749643_5568x3712.jpeg)\n\nSo, I realized that X is a product only if it can sustainably bring in cash for a company.\n\nAnd, from my previous reading, I learned that the stage at which a company has high confidence in its ability to bring in cash sustainably is called a Product-Market Fit (PMF).\n\n**So, if we accept both those definitions to be accurate, then a company can’t have a product pre-PMF.**\n\nThis crashed my brain again. Previously, I had also learned that a startup should build an MVP or a Minimum Viable Product — A PRODUCT — pre-PMF and iterate it quickly to reach the PMF. But if a company can’t have a Product pre-PMF, what in the world is an MVP?\n\nInspired came to the rescue again, here is what Marty writes _(as if he is speaking directly to me)_:\n\nI think the root of the issue is that while the P in MVP stands for product, an MVP should never be an actual product (where product is defined as something that your developers can release with confidence, that your customers can run their business on, and that you can sell and support). The MVP should be a prototype, not a product.\n\nBuilding an actual product-quality deliverable to learn, even if that deliverable has minimal functionality, leads to substantial waste of time and money, which of course is the antithesis of Lean.\n\nI find that using the more general term prototype makes this critical point clear to the product team, the company, and the prospective customers.\n\nAnd then clarity struck, a Prototype and a Product, when properly defined, are two fundamentally different things. Prototypes are primarily optimized for speed and cost, Products are primarily optimized for quality. Prototypes exist pre-PMF, and Products exist post-PMF.\n\nThis new mental model of what a product was further supported and enhanced when I scanned the book Lean Analytics again:\n\nIt’s important to note that the MVP is a process, not a product.\n\nAnd when I realized that a **Prototype** (MVP) is just a process to reach a **Product**, it crystallized the differentiation between the two even more. The difference was clear and there was absolutely no scope for confusion anymore.\n\nHowever, this clarity brought me to a new crossroads, a new dilemma - Am I fascinated with Product Management or Prototype Management?\n\n### Prototype (NOT Product) Management\n\nI think Prototype Management is fundamentally different from Product Management. Both, of course, have a lot of similarities in principles and share a lot of tools and techniques. For example, both involve iterations, experiments, testing, measuring, and pivoting. And, both involve making wireframes, writing user stories, A/B tests, etc.\n\nHowever, I think both are so different that Product Management and Prototype Management should be different roles altogether. Here are two reasons for my belief.\n\n**One,** both have fundamentally different start states and end states.\n\nProduct management starts with an already existing product that makes money and aims to improve the product or add additional features/products. Prototype management starts with nothing and aims to discover the Product around which a business could be built.\n\n**Two,** both demand people with very different mindsets and characteristics.\n\nI have serious doubts that the majority of people from the post-PMF (Product) environment, can thrive in the chaotic pre-PMF (Prototype) environments. Or, the people in the pre-PMF (Prototype) environment can thrive in the structured post-PMF (Product) environment.\n\n## The Final Word\n\nWhether Product Management and Prototype Management get differentiated in the real world over time, only time can tell. But, whatever the case might be, I realized that the Product management I was fascinated with, was not the Product Management that Basecamp folks were talking about. In fact, it wasn’t Product Management at all, it was Prototype Management - a process of making something that brings in cash, out of nothing, by fast, cheap, and consistent trial and error.\n\nOverall, this was a fun little exploration for me, it made me think, and I hope that was the case for you too.\n\n##### **Books and Other Sources**\n\n[Getting Real](https://basecamp.com/gettingreal)\n\n[INSPIRED: How to Create Tech Products Customers Love](https://www.svpg.com/books/inspired-how-to-create-tech-products-customers-love-2nd-edition/)\n\n[YC's Essential Startup Advice](https://www.ycombinator.com/library/4D-yc-s-essential-startup-advice)\n\n[Lean Analytics - Use data to build a better startup faster](https://leananalyticsbook.com/)\n\n[THE LEAN PRODUCT PLAYBOOK](https://leanproductplaybook.com/)\n\nThanks for reading Ideabox!

But such is the case with very many scholars; they have read themselves stupid...”\n>\n> Arthur Schopenhauer\n\n![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6e44e7a7-c459-452b-81c2-0ed1be744c5c_1920x1920.jpeg)\n\nReading Schopenhauer was fascinating. His take on books and thoughtful reading changed the way I consume ideas. As I went deep into his ideas on reading, I realized that sharing his ideas was essential. For that, I have chosen the passages that are most useful, reflected on those, and elaborated if necessary. \n\n## **On Ignorance**\n\n> **Ignorance degrades a man only when it is found in company with wealth**. A poor man is subdued by his poverty and distress; with him his work takes the place of knowledge and occupies his thoughts. On the other hand, the wealthy who are ignorant live merely for their pleasures and are like animals, as can be seen every day…\n>\n> Arthur Schopenhauer\n\nConsider yourself wealthy. You are as wealthy as the wealthiest men Schopenhauer mentions in his writings. \n\nSchopenhauer lived during the 1800s. Technology was primitive, resources were limited, and making a living was the main priority. People had a justification for their ignorance - lack of knowledge. But since then, the world has gotten much better. Look at these charts compiled by VOX.\n\n[23 charts and maps that show the world is getting much, much better](https://www.vox.com/2014/11/24/7272929/global-poverty-health-crime-literacy-good-news)\n\nMost of us have significantly better lives than people in the 1800s. So, for most of us, ignorance - lack of knowledge -  is degrading. \n\nReading is one way to get past ignorance. However, there is a kind of reading that does more harm than good - Passive Reading.\n\n## **On Reading Passively**\n\n> When we read, someone else thinks for us; we repeat merely his mental process. It is like the pupil who, when learning to write, goes over with his pen the strokes made in pencil by the teacher. Accordingly, when we read, the work of thinking is for the most part taken away from us. Hence the noticeable relief when from preoccupation with our thoughts we pass to reading. But while we are reading our mind is really only the playground of other people’s ideas; and when these finally depart, what remains? The result is that, whoever reads very much and almost the entire day but at intervals amuses himself with thoughtless pastime, gradually loses the ability to think for himself; just as a man who always rides ultimately forgets how to walk. \n\nReading is not always passive. I think Schopenhauer is correct when he says “_When we read, someone else thinks for us; we repeat merely his mental process_”. But, I disagree when he says ”_the work of thinking is for the most part taken away from us_”. \n\nI believe that the end goal of reading is understanding. If we are reading an unfamiliar topic, we have to think to understand it. Such a topic demands effort from us and therefore can’t be read passively. It demands active reading. \n\nThe problem of passive reading arises when a topic is familiar - something that you already understand to some extent. The reading now seems easy as it demands minimal to no effort. This sends us to a zone where we are just reading passively - in an accepting manner, without active response or resistance.  I think Schopenhauer warns us about passive reading - the undemanding, easy, and effortless kind of reading.\n\n## **On Reading Actively** \n\n> … many scholars; they have read themselves stupid. For constant reading, which is at once resumed at every free moment, is even more paralysing to the mind than is manual work; for with the latter we can give free play to our own thoughts. Just as a spring finally loses its elasticity through the constant pressure of a foreign body, so does the mind through the continual pressure of other people’s ideas...For the more we read, the fewer the traces that are left behind in the mind by what has been read. It becomes like a blackboard whereon many things have been written over one another. Hence we never come to ruminate; but only through this do we assimilate what we have read, just as food nourishes us not by being eaten but by being digested. On the other hand, **if we are for ever reading without afterwards thinking further about what we have read, this does not take root and for the most part is lost** ...\n>\n> **In addition to all this, is the fact that thoughts reduced to paper are generally nothing more than the footprints of a man walking in the sand. It is true that we see the path he has taken; but to know what he saw on the way, we must use our own eyes.**\n\nHow to read actively?  I think Schopenhauer tries to answer this question here. I will try to do the same and summarise my process of active reading as briefly as I can:\n\nActive reading makes you think - synthesize thoughts and assimilate ideas. If we invert this statement, that means thinking throughout the reading process is essential to think. Any reading process has three stages: pre-reading, reading, and post-reading. To extract complete value from reading, you must do some form of thinking at all stages. Here I describe thinking at each stage one by one. \n\nBut first, childish questions about learning, thinking, and memory. Go back and imagine yourself as a 12-year-old self, asking these questions and reliving your childhood.\n\n---\n\n---\n\n*Why do we read?* \n\nWe read to learn. \n\n*What is learning?* \n\nLearning is the acquisition of new knowledge.\n\n*But what is knowledge?*  \n\nKnowledge is an awareness of or familiarity with various concepts. \n\n_What are concepts?_  \n\nA concept is a mental grouping of similar objects, events, ideas, or people. \n\n*If we read to learn concepts, then why don’t we just memorize a dictionary?* \n\nBecause your brain does not understand information like that. \n\n*How does my brain understand information?* \n\nYour brain understands information in the form of meaningful clusters called chunks. \n\n*Chunks?* \n\nChunks are groups of related concepts in which your brain can find some meaning. \n\n*I don’t understand, can you give me an example?* \n\n> Okay. A chunk can be in the form of an article, a chapter, a research paper, a video etc. Any group of concepts that make sense together. Therefore, all great knowledge is usually written or presented in the form of chunks. Your brain understands them, processes them and stores them. \n\n*How does it do that?* \n\n> It breaks down chunks into concepts, organises the concepts into categories and then uses them when a new situation arrives. \n\n*So wait. We combine concepts and give them meaning so that the brain understands them. Then the brain then breaks them all down again into concepts to store them. Isn’t that inefficient?* \n\n> Yes, it is. But that is how the brain functions. It is very similar to the body - we can’t process and use nutrients directly. Nutrients make food, we consume food, and our bodies extract nutrients out of it. \n\n*What about supplements? Don’t we just eat multivitamins?* \n\nYes, we do. \n\n_So, Can’t there be concept pills that our brain can directly process?_\n\n> Yes, that can be done. Not with a pill but something like a USB cable that can directly change concepts in our brain. But there is a problem -  the brain is like the genie from Aladdin. We understand what it can do, but we know very little about how it does what it does. So changing something we don’t understand is not a good idea - just like that remote control you opened and changed. \n\n_Oh. I see. So, is there no hope of a cable?_\n\n> Yes there is. A very smart man named Elon Musk is trying to build one. It is called neuralink. Go home and read about it. \n\n_But, How…._\n\n… Enough for now. Let's move on.\n\nI could have handed you a list of all these terms. But, as we know now, the brain does not work like that. This whole conversation was an example of a chunk of knowledge. \n\n##### **Thinking Before Reading**\n\nConsider that you are going to read an independent chunk of knowledge - an article, a chapter, a paper, etc. At this stage of thinking, you should think about a chunk as a whole. You must be clear about:\n\n1.  Its Purpose: Why are you reading it?\n2.  Its Presence: Is this chunk, or the concepts in it, present in my _knowledge base_?\n3.  Its Position: If not, where does this chunk fit into my knowledge base?\n\n##### **Thinking During Reading**\n\nThinking at this stage is done to achieve two goals: Engagement and Analysis. You can do that in the following ways:\n\n1.  Engagement: By annotating and taking notes as you read. \n2.  Analysis: First, break down the chunk into concepts - the main ideas the author is talking about. Then, identify the central claim that the author is making using these ideas. Understand the central claim. What are the assumptions? What are the conclusions? What are the implications of the conclusions? \n\n##### **Thinking Post Reading**\n\nThinking after reading is of two types: short-term thinking and long-term thinking. \n\n1.  Short-term thinking \n\n> It is thinking you do immediately after reading. The purpose of short term thinking is to encode the concepts in your brain. Encoding is the process of increasing permanence of  a concept. \n>\n> Human minds are efficient. This efficiency is driven by our ability to forget irrelevant knowledge. Concepts that are not important are removed to make way for new concepts. That means, if you don’t explicitly show the importance of a concept to your mind, it will forget the concept. The purpose of encoding is **explicitly** telling your mind what not to forget.\n>\n> You can achieve this purpose by adding retrievable mental cues to the concepts to your mind. With mental cues, you can retrieve stored knowledge at a later stage of reading or application. \n>\n> You can add mental cues about a concept of knowledge in two ways. First, by elaborating on what you have read - _thinking about the concept from different perspectives, finding how it connects to your life, adding additional layers of meaning to it_. Second, by reflecting on what you have read - _pausing and asking questions about the concept_. \n\n2.  Long-term thinking \n\n> It is the thinking that you do after you have allowed the knowledge to age for a bit. There are two reasons for doing long-term thinking. First, to revisit the memory cues created during short-term thinking to strengthen the cues. Second, to connect new ideas that you have assimilated since last reading to restructure your knowledge. \n>\n> How to do long-term thinking? There are three steps for doing it. The first two steps for long-term thinking are the same as that for short term thinking - elaboration and reflection. Only in this case you elaborate and reflect on how the knowledge has changed in your mind since the last reading. \n>\n> There is an additional third step to long-term thinking called creation. This means adding your own perspective to the knowledge so that you can apply it in your own life. You take a stand on the assumptions, conclusions and implication of the knowledge that you believe to be true. You can also decide on what new knowledge, if discovered, will change your stand. \n>\n> Long-term thinking is an iterative process. In the beginning, that is for the first couple of long term thinking sessions, you must be deliberate in scheduling. That means that you create some system to schedule your long term thinking sessions. After a while, if you are consistent with your general reading, you will see the same concepts pop up everywhere and thinking about the world in terms of these concepts will become an automatic process.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe principle is to think while you read, assimilate the knowledge, nourish the mind with what you have understood, and revisit this understanding constantly. You can use different rules or processes as long as you stick to the principle. It will give you the best chance to NOT read yourself stupid. \n\n**Warning**\n\nI must warn you about two things. \n\n1.  What I have described here is just a map of my process; it barely scratches the surface. Each stage has a lot of depth, nuances, and pitfalls. So, don’t follow it rigidly or blindly. \n2.  This is not a universal process. My aim here was to give you something to think about and then discover your own way. \n\n**Definitions**\n\n1.  Knowledge: awareness of or familiarity with various objects, events, ideas, or ways of doing things.\n2.  Learning: learning involves the acquisition of new knowledge, skills, or responses from experience that results in a relatively permanent change in the state of the learner.\n3.  Concept: a mental grouping of similar objects, events, ideas, or people.\n4.  Chunking: chunking involves combining small pieces of information into larger clusters or chunks that are more easily held in short-term memory.\n5.  Knowledge Base: A physical or digital storage space where concepts are organized in categories and stored. \n6.  Encoding: Encoding is the process of transforming into a lasting memory the information our senses take in. \n7.  Retrieval: Retrieval is the process of bringing to mind information that has been previously encoded and stored.\n8.  Mental Cues:  External information that is associated with stored information and helps bring it to mind. They are also called retrieval cues. \n9.  Elaboration: Elaboration is the process of finding additional layers of meaning in new material. \n10. Reflection: Reflection is the act of taking a few minutes to review what has been learned in a recent class or experience and asking yourself questions.\n","id":"1489b7e1-915c-40db-afaf-4c9433950ca9"},"29":{"slug":"scientific-method","title":"The Scientific Method Doesn’t Exist","shortTitle":"The Scientific Method Doesn’t Exist","description":"","tags":"","heroImage":"","createdAt":"2025-04-13T00:00:00.000Z","content":"\nimport DefinitionsCarousel from \"./components/definitions-carousel\";\n\nI started this exploration wanting to answer what I thought was a simple question: \"What is the scientific method?\" It wasn't a simple question. This whole journey made me question ideas I had accumulated throughout my education. In this post, I document my journey.\n\n## A Neat Illusion\n\nTextbooks make the scientific method look simple, obvious, and easy to understand. The model of a scientific method presented by most textbooks is this.\n\n> The scientific method is a systematic process for acquiring knowledge through observation, formulating a testable hypothesis, conducting experiments to test the hypothesis, analyzing the results, and drawing conclusions to refine or reject the hypothesis.\n\nHere are excerpts from some sources around the world.\n\n<DefinitionsCarousel />\n\nEach of these descriptions presents a model of the scientific method that is clean, step-wise, and easy to remember - first, you do this, then that, and so on. It's clean, it's logical, it's imaginable, it's teachable. This model works if you aim to understand the definition, to explain the meaning to others, to score marks in your school, or to score points with your boss.\n\nBut does it work for practicing science?\n\n## Messy Realities\n\nFor most working scientists, the purpose of scientific inquiry is to get as close as possible to the truth and to form a model of reality you can reliably act on. The path of seeking the truth is not the straight-line path that the textbooks describe.\n\nIn 1928, Alexander Fleming, a professor of bacteriology, returned from a vacation to notice that mold had grown in one of his bacterial culture plates and all the bacteria in it were dead. He isolated the mold and tested its juices on another bacterial culture, and they killed the bacterial culture. The juices were later named \"penicillin\".\n\nThe experiment happened by chance. He formed the hypothesis after the fact and then he tried testing it to confirm it. Was this any less scientific, or any less true?\n\n## Philosophy Meets Science\n\nWho decides what is and is not science? Who are the people who study this? What do they have to say about the topic? In my exploration, I landed on the domain of \"Philosophy of Science\". Here I learned that we don’t even have a fixed definition of science, let alone the method. I would recommend avoiding the \"Philosophy of Science\" rabbit hole, but to give you a taste of it, here are some disagreements that philosophers of science have.\n\n1. How do we draw a line between real science and pseudo-science? (The Problem of Demarcation)\n2. Can we justify using past observations to predict future events? (Problem of Induction)\n3. Do science’s “unseen” entities exist, or are they handy fictions? Do electrons exist or are they a model that helps us predict how wires carry electricity? (Realism vs. Anti-realism)\n4. Can everything be fully explained by what it's made of, or do complex systems have their own rules? (Reductionism vs. Emergence)\n5. Do scientists uncover facts already out there, or do lab debates, funding pressures, and publication politics forge them? (Objective Facts vs. Social Construction)\n\nOne of these disagreements is \"Methodological Monism vs. Pluralism\" - must there be one strict “scientific method,” or is it better to allow several methods? This is an open question. We don't have a consensus on this. That essentially means we don't have a consensus on \"What is the scientific method?\" At this point, I don't even know whether to frame the question with \"a scientific method\" or \"the scientific method\".\n\n## Finding Common Ground\n\nHow do we know we are doing science? Well, we agree on answers to some of the questions of science. Here are the 6 major ones.\n\n1. What ultimately decides between rival claims?\n   - Observational/Experimental Evidence\n   - Example: Take your thermometer's reading instead of guessing you have a fever.\n2. Are scientific conclusions final?\n   - No. All knowledge is provisional and fallible.\n   - Example: Newtonian mechanics worked for centuries until relativity corrected it.\n3. Must scientific results be reproducible?\n   - Yes. Independent replication is necessary. Where direct reruns are impossible - say, a supernova - scientists demand reproducible analysis pipelines instead.\n   - Example: Chemists publish full protocols so any competent lab can re-run the synthesis.\n4. What makes a model worth keeping?\n   - The ability to predict and/or explain phenomena beyond what inspired the original model.\n   - Example: Mendel's genetics predicted 3:1 ratios in pea traits he had not yet counted.\n5. Should scientific inquiry be subjective or objective?\n   - Objective - free from personal or cultural bias.\n   - Example: Double-blind drug trials strip away doctors' and patients' expectations.\n6. Can causes be supernatural?\n   - No. Science brackets the supernatural by methodological choice, not because it can disprove it.\n   - Example: Meteorologists model floods with fluid dynamics, not divine wrath.\n\nHow do we do science? By using tools such as these, to form theories and to establish the probability of their truth, but there is NO fixed path to getting there. Some rely on tools such as gathering data, making hypotheses, running experiments, proposing theories, objectivity, reproducibility, etc. A scientist may use some or all. But, no single process or method connects them. You don't have to gather data or observe a phenomenon to form a hypothesis; you don't need to propose theories after experimentation. You can pick tools in a different order, and you can use tools more than once.\n\nThe scientific process is fluid. If your theories are open to change, other scientists can replicate your experiments, your data is not intentionally biased, and so on, you are doing science. Some theories demand massive datasets - like vaccine trials with thousands of participants - while others hinge on a single, precise observation - like the 1919 eclipse that showed starlight bending around the sun, confirming general relativity. Some need statistical methods, some need laboratory methods. Some experiments require precise conditions, while you can run others in the wild.\n\nSome organizations publish field-specific guides:\n\n- NIH on human trials\n- OECD on social-science protocols\n- CONSORT for randomised-trial reporting\n- APA ethics, ASTM materials testing, FAIR data principles\n\n## Why Textbooks Lie\n\nThen why are textbooks the way they are? Why do they teach a linear, unambiguous scientific method?\n\nIdeas in textbooks work on the principle of scaffolding - simpler models are often easier to understand and provide a foundation for learning more complex concepts. We intentionally reduce the complexity to make the real models understandable. It's the same reason we still teach the Newtonian theory of gravity, instead of Einstein's - it provides a simpler model that works well for most real-world situations until we hit a wall, question the model, and graduate to a better model.\n\nTeaching the scientific method in this way has a mnemonic value - it helps people remember scientific tools by presenting a single linear narrative. Linear narratives and causalities are easier for humans to follow. The simple scientific method is a scaffolding for this real scientific method. It's not the actual thing.\n\nThis approach to scaffolding complex ideas works because our education/workforce system works with the assumption that ONLY experts will use these tools in situations of consequence. You would need to go away from Newton's model of gravity to Einstein's model if you were a rocket scientist. And if you are a rocket scientist, you would know NOT to apply the simpler model because you learned about the nuance, first, in your higher education and, then, in the initial years of your job.\n\nSimilarly, for the scientific method, the system assumes that people will learn the nuance when they do actual science and until then a complex model is not needed.\n\nSome textbooks come with a warning about this reduction of complexity.\n\n<DefinitionsCarousel hasWarnings />\n\n## When Simplicity Fails\n\n> Only experts will use these tools in situations of consequence\n\nBut does this assumption hold in the real world?\n\nTake the example of people who vote for rent control for apartments. They use the standard model of supply and demand. In the rental market, the price is set to the point where how many people want apartments (demand) meets how many landlords offer them (supply). According to them, if you fix the maximum rent of an apartment it ensures that landlords can't exploit the tenants and more people can afford housing. And, since rent control often exempts luxury properties, those stay out of the purview of rent control. Logical? Yes. Does it work? No.\n\nThis is what happens. Landlords convert the apartments into condos so that they are out of the definition of rent control. In San Francisco, [expanding control in 1994](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/what-does-economic-evidence-tell-us-about-the-effects-of-rent-control/) prompted landlords to convert buildings to condos or neglect maintenance, shrinking the rental stock by up to 15 percentage points and attracting higher-income newcomers, thereby accelerating gentrification.\n\nNon-experts can and do apply these basic models. They do it in policy, in government, in technology, in business. All ideas are not equal. Scaffolding works for physics because physics research is largely confined to trained physicists, whereas supply-and-demand curves or \"the scientific method\" are used by a much wider public. The \"scientific method\" shapes decisions in medicine, policy, and technology. That scaffolding breaks when non-experts wield simplified models in policy.\n\nPeople who encounter a simple five-step cartoon either treat it as childishly simplistic or, paradoxically, reject it as over-engineered jargon; in both cases, they ignore the real, flexible practice of science. In both cases, it's a net loss for everyone.\n\n## Intellectual Humility\n\nWhat do we do? I have a simple answer: intellectual humility. Intellectual humility is knowing that your knowledge has limits. It's the willingness to say, \"I don't know\" or \"I may be wrong\". Treat the textbook diagram as a mnemonic, not a map, and stay curious enough to know when you’ve left the paved road.\n","id":"98cfc23b-ecda-493d-86c9-c88658c45f2b"},"30":{"slug":"some-questions-are-stupid","title":"Some questions are stupid.","shortTitle":"Some questions are stupid.","description":"","tags":"","heroImage":"","createdAt":"2022-08-23","content":"I think “There are no stupid questions” is a stupid statement. It assumes that everyone has the same definition of stupid. It also assumes that everyone means the same thing when they call some questions stupid. To know if a question is stupid, one has to first know what stupidity means.\n\nWhat is stupidity? Take a moment to think on your own and come up with a definition before you read ahead.\n\n---\n\nOxford defines it as “having or showing a great lack of intelligence or common sense.” This definition of stupidity is equally vague as the word itself. What is intelligence? What is common sense? How does one estimate both these things, in the moment, when one calls out something as stupid? By this definition, you can call anyone stupid based on your conception of common sense or intelligence. Due to this intentional ambiguity, the word gets thrown around left, right and center, without anyone actually knowing its meaning.\n\nI prefer more useful definitions, at least when possible. Definitions I can use while I speak, write or think. For that reason, I am borrowing Carlo Cipolla’s definition of stupidity in this post. (I highly recommend reading his book on stupidity for a deeper dive into the concept.) Cipolla’s definition is useful and can be quickly applied while thinking.\n\n**Stupidity**: The act of harming others without procuring any gain for oneself.\n\nIf you are harming others without gaining anything for yourself, you are probably stupid. By this definition, you are asking a stupid question if the question harms others without you getting anything out of the answer. Let’s break it down\n\n1.  A stupid question has to be harmful to the one who answers.\n    \n2.  The answer to a stupid question must be of no gain to the one who questions.\n    \n\nHow can a question be of harm? Because answering any question takes time and wasting someone’s time is one of the worse kinds of suffering you can inflict on someone. Wasting time is harmful and therefore any questions that waste time is harmful too.\n\nAnswering every question takes time, and that is why the second part of the definition - the gain part - is important. The stupidity of a question can be measured by the harm-to-gain ratio of the question.\n\n-   Harm > Gain, On the stupid side of the spectrum\n    \n-   Gain > Harm, On the good side of the spectrum\n    \n-   Gain = 0, Infinitely Stupid\n    \n\nThe worse kinds of stupid questions take a long time to answer and are yet of no use to the one who asks.\n\nNow having defined what ‘Stupid Questions’ mean. Let’s look at an example of a stupid question that people have asked me about books. I am inflicting self-harm by answering this question because I think it will reduce the harm suffered by the collective, in the long term.\n\n#### How many books should one read in a year?\n\nLet’s say I answer this question with the number 12. How is that useful? Am I reading 12 books of 200 or 1200 pages each? Am I reading fiction, non-fiction, or college textbooks? Let’s say I answer - I read twelve, 200-page non-fiction books a year. Even that answer is useless. Am I reading a book that is objectively dense to ready? Or am I reading a pop science book? Am I reading history or physics? Am I reading a book in my domain, or out of my domain? I think I have made the point. The harm-to-gain ratio of this question is very high. There is almost no real gain to the one who asks that question, other than emotional satisfaction, irrespective of the time taken to answer or the precision of the answer.\n\nLike this question practically all questions, with respect to reading, that start with ‘How many’ are stupid. Also are the questions that deal with reading speed.\n\n#### Summary\n\n-   Yes, some questions are stupid.\n    \n-   The stupidity of a question can be measured by the harm-to-gain ratio of the question.\n    \n-   The harm is usually in the form of time.\n    \n\n```\nVersion: Draft 1\n```\n","id":"358a2970-1436-4c01-98c7-b561ad9b4b2a"},"31":{"slug":"sweetener-options","title":"Battle of the Sweeteners","shortTitle":"Battle of the Sweeteners","description":"","tags":"","heroImage":"","createdAt":"2025-03-16T00:00:00.000Z","content":"\nimport SweetenerList from \"./components/list\";\n\n<SweetenerList />\n","id":"7b471ad4-056e-4990-9a43-7dd2dc2f81cb"},"32":{"slug":"the-amazon-os","title":"The Amazon OS","shortTitle":"The Amazon OS","description":"","tags":"","heroImage":"","createdAt":"2021-05-21","content":"\n[Originally Published on May 22, 2021](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/what-jeff-bezos-wants-you-remember-amazon-why-does-prashant-bhudwal/)\n\n![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2821e39c-d5bd-470c-8954-ba4b83ccfa81_1081x720.jpeg)\n\n## **How your memory works**\n\nThink of the last vacation that you took. Take some time to remember whatever you can, from that vacation.\n\nHere is my guess about how you remember your vacation.\n\nYou remember:\n\n- peaks - the restaurant you went to, the sunset you saw, the ride you took, the time you got so drunk that you couldn't stand, and\n- end - the last day, the last dinner, the last journey.\n\nPsychologist [Daniel Kahneman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Kahneman) calls this the '[Peak-end rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peak%E2%80%93end_rule)'.\n\nYou remember your past experiences based on how you felt on the:\n\n- peaks of those experiences - the most intense points,\n- end of those experiences - the conclusions\n\nAnother phenomenon that he figured out is this -\n\nYou DON'T remember the length of your experiences. The days you spent on the vacation just blend together into one memory. Your memory is not based on the number of days you spent on the vacation but on the snapshots of peaks and ends. If your vacation had just 10 intense moments then it does not matter if it was a 1-day vacation, a 1-week vacation or a 1-month vacation. You will remember all these vacations as being very similar. This is called [duration neglect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duration_neglect).\n\n## What Jeff Bezos Wants You To Remember about Amazon\n\nBezos like all great writers knows these rules intuitively. In Amazon's annual shareholder letters he makes full use of these rules. He knows that as people read his letters they won't remember how long or detailed the letters were - how many graphs they had or how many numbers were discussed. They will just remember the peaks of their reading experiences and the ends of the letters.\n\n## The Peaks\n\nSo, the letters are short and every letter focuses intensely on a few points that he wants you to remember. He gives many examples that evoke empathy and emotion in any reader. These form the peaks of his letters. I have written a [series of posts](https://ideabox.substack.com/p/the-philosophy-of-jeff-bezos-part) on these peaks.\n\n## The Ends\n\nThis post is about the ends. Bezos gives special attention to how he ends each of his letters. These are the crux of everything that Bezos wants you to remember about Amazon as a company in the long term. So, I have compiled all the ends of his shareholder letters from 1997-2020 in this post.\n\nThe last two paragraphs of his letters are the place where the magic happens. These paragraphs are can be read without much context and they summarise the reasoning behind why Amazon does what it does.\n\n**1997:**\n\nWe now know vastly more about online commerce than when Amazon.com was founded, but we still have so much to learn. Though we are optimistic, we must remain vigilant and maintain a sense of urgency. The challenges and hurdles we will face to make our long-term vision for Amazon.com a reality are several: aggressive, capable, well-funded competition; considerable growth challenges and execution risk; the risks of product and geographic expansion; and the need for large continuing investments to meet an expanding market opportunity. However, as we’ve long said, online bookselling, and online commerce in general, should prove to be a very large market, and it’s likely that a number of companies will see significant benefit. We feel good about what we’ve done, and even more excited about what we want to do.\n\nWe at Amazon.com are grateful to our customers for their business and trust, to each other for our hard work, and to our shareholders for their support and encouragement.\n\n**1998:**\n\nThe most important thing I could say in this letter was said in last year’s letter, which detailed our long-term investment approach. Because we have so many new shareholders (this year we’re printing more than two hundred thousand of these letters—last year we printed about thirteen thousand), we’ve appended last year’s letter immediately after this year’s. I invite you to please read the section titled “It’s All About the Long Term.” You might want to read it twice to make sure we’re the kind of company you want to be invested in. As it says there, we don’t claim it’s the right philosophy, we just claim it’s ours!\n\nAll the best and sincere thanks once again to our customers and shareholders and all the folks here who are working passionately every day to build an important and lasting company.\n\n**1999:**\n\nIn closing, consider this most important point: the current online shopping experience is the worst it will ever be. It’s good enough today to attract seventeen million customers, but it will get so much better. Increased bandwidth will result in faster page views and richer content. Further improvements will lead to “always-on access” (which I expect will be a strong boost to online shopping at home, as opposed to the office) and we’ll see significant growth in non-PC devices and wireless access. Moreover, it’s great to be participating in what is a multi-trillion-dollar global market, in which we are so very, very tiny. We are doubly blessed. We have a market-size unconstrained opportunity in an area where the underlying foundational technology we employ improves every day. That is not normal.\n\nAs always, we at Amazon.com remain grateful to our customers for their business and trust, to each other for our hard work, and to our shareholders for their support and encouragement. Many, many thanks.\n\n**2000:**\n\nThe year 2001 will be an important one in our development. Like 2000, this year will be a year of focus and execution. As a first step, we’ve set the goal of achieving a pro forma operating profit in the fourth quarter. While we have a tremendous amount of work to do and there can be no guarantees, we have a plan to get there, it’s our top priority, and every person in this company is committed to helping with that goal. I look forward to reporting to you our progress in the coming year.\n\nWe at Amazon.com remain grateful to our customers for their business and trust, to each other for our hard work, and to our shareholders for their support and encouragement. Many, many thanks.\n\n**2001:**\n\nAs I’ve discussed many times before, we are firm believers that the long-term interests of shareholders are tightly linked to the interests of our customers: if we do our jobs right, today’s customers will buy more tomorrow, we’ll add more customers in the process, and it will all add up to more cash flow and more long-term value for our shareholders. To that end, we are committed to extending our leadership in e-commerce in a way that benefits customers and therefore, inherently, investors—you can’t do one without the other.\n\nAs we kick off 2002, I am happy to report that I am as enthusiastic as ever about this business. There is more innovation ahead of us than behind us, we are close to demonstrating the operating leverage of our business model, and I get to work with this amazing team of Amazonians all over the world. I am lucky and grateful. We thank you, our owners, for your support, your encouragement, and for joining us on this adventure. If you’re a customer, we thank you again!\n\n**2002:**\n\nIn short, what’s good for customers is good for shareholders.\n\nOnce again this year, I attach a copy of our original 1997 letter and encourage current and prospective shareowners to take a look at it. Given how much we’ve grown and how much the Internet has evolved, it’s notable that the fundamentals of how we do business remain the same.\n\n**2003:**\n\nWe have a strong team of hard-working, innovative folks building Amazon.com. They are focused on the customer and focused on the long term. On that time scale, the interests of shareowners and customers are aligned.\n\nP.S. Again this year, the widely followed American Customer Satisfaction Index gave Amazon.com a score of eighty-eight—the highest customer satisfaction score ever recorded in any service industry, online or off. A representative of the ACSI was quoted as saying, “If they go any higher, they will get a nosebleed.” We’re working on that.\n\n**2004:**\n\nThis focus on free cash flow isn’t new for Amazon.com. We made it clear in our 1997 letter to shareholders—our first as a public company—that when “forced to choose between optimizing GAAP accounting and maximizing the present value of future cash flows, we’ll take the cash flows.”\n\n**2005:**\n\nThe foundation of our decision-making philosophy was laid out in our 1997 letter to shareholders, a copy of which is [attached](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-bezos-captained-his-ship-from-1997-2000-jeff-prashant-bhudwal/)...\n\nYou can count on us to combine a strong quantitative and analytical culture with a willingness to make bold decisions. As we do so, we’ll start with the customer and work backward. In our judgment, that is the best way to create shareholder value.\n\n**2006:**\n\nIn our experience, if a new business enjoys runaway success, it can only _begin_ to be meaningful to the overall company economics in something like three to seven years. We’ve seen those time frames with our international businesses, our earlier nonmedia businesses, and our third-party seller businesses. Today, international is 45 percent of sales, nonmedia is 34 percent of sales, and our third-party seller businesses account for 28 percent of our units sold. We will be happy indeed if some of the new seeds we’re planting enjoy similar successes.\n\nWe’ve come a distance since we celebrated our first $10 million in sales. As we continue to grow, we’ll work to maintain a culture that embraces new businesses. We will do so in a disciplined way, with an eye on returns, potential size, and the ability to create differentiation that customers care about. We won’t always choose right, and we won’t always succeed. But we will be choosy, and we will work hard and patiently.\n\n**2007:**\n\nYour team of missionaries here is fervent about driving free cash flow per share and returns on capital. We know we can do that by putting customers first. I guarantee you there is more innovation ahead of us than behind us, and we do not expect the road to be an easy one. We’re hopeful, and I’d even say optimistic, that Kindle, true to its name, will “start a fire” and improve the world of reading.\n\nKindle exemplifies our philosophy and long-term investment approach discussed in our first letter to shareholders in 1997.\n\n**2008:**\n\nOur primary financial goal remains maximizing long-term free cash flow and doing so with high rates of return on invested capital. We are investing heartily in Amazon Web Services, in tools for third-party sellers, in digital media, in China, and in new product categories. And we make these investments with the belief that they can be of meaningful scale and can clear our high bar for returns.\n\nAround the world, amazing, inventive, and hard-working Amazonians are putting customers first. I take great pride in being part of this team. We thank you, our owners, for your support, for your encouragement, and for joining us on our continuing adventure.\n\n**2009:**\n\nTaken as a whole, the set of goals is indicative of our fundamental approach. Start with customers and work backward. Listen to customers, but don’t _just_ listen to customers—also invent on their behalf. We can’t assure you that we’ll meet all of this year’s goals. We haven’t in past years. However, we can assure you that we’ll continue to obsess over customers. We have strong conviction that that approach—in the long term—is every bit as good for owners as it is for customers.\n\nIt’s still Day 1.\n\n**2010:**\n\nWe live in an era of extraordinary increases in available bandwidth, disk space, and processing power, all of which continue to get cheap fast. We have on our team some of the most sophisticated technologists in the world—helping to solve challenges that are right on the edge of what’s possible today. As I’ve discussed many times before, we have unshakeable conviction that the long-term interests of shareowners are perfectly aligned with the interests of customers.\n\nAnd we like it that way. Invention is in our DNA and technology is the fundamental tool we wield to evolve and improve every aspect of the experience we provide our customers. We still have a lot to learn, and I expect and hope we’ll continue to have so much fun learning it. I take great pride in being part of this team.\n\nIt’s still Day 1.\n\n**2011:**\n\nAmazonians are leaning into the future, with radical and transformational innovations that create value for thousands of authors, entrepreneurs, and developers. Invention has become second nature at Amazon, and in my view the team’s pace of innovation is even accelerating—I can assure you it’s very energizing. I’m extremely proud of the whole team and feel lucky to have a front row seat.\n\nIt’s still Day 1!\n\n**2012:**\n\nAs proud as I am of our progress and our inventions, I know that we will make mistakes along the way—some will be self-inflicted, some will be served up by smart and hard-working competitors. Our passion for pioneering will drive us to explore narrow passages, and, unavoidably, many will turn out to be blind alleys. But—with a bit of good fortune—there will also be a few that open up into broad avenues.\n\nI am incredibly lucky to be a part of this large team of outstanding missionaries who value our customers as much as I do and who demonstrate that every day with their hard work.\n\n**2013:**\n\nWe have the good fortune of a large, inventive team and a patient, pioneering, customer-obsessed culture—great innovations, large and small, are happening every day on behalf of customers, and at all levels throughout the company. This decentralized distribution of invention throughout the company—not limited to the company’s senior leaders—is the only way to get robust, high-throughput innovation. What we’re doing is challenging and fun—we get to work in the future. Failure comes part and parcel with invention. It’s not optional. We understand that and believe in failing early and iterating until we get it right. When this process works, it means our failures are relatively small in size (most experiments can start small), and when we hit on something that is really working for customers, we double-down on it with hopes to turn it into an even bigger success. However, it’s not always as clean as that. Inventing is messy, and over time, it’s certain that we’ll fail at some big bets too.\n\nI feel super lucky to be a part of the Amazon team. It’s still Day 1.\n\n**2014:**\n\nMarketplace, Prime, and Amazon Web Services are three big ideas. We’re lucky to have them, and we’re determined to improve and nurture them—make them even better for customers. You can also count on us to work hard to find a fourth. We’ve already got a number of candidates in the works, and as we promised some twenty years ago, we’ll continue to make bold bets. With the opportunities unfolding in front of us to serve customers better through invention, we assure you we won’t stop trying.\n\nIt’s still Day 1.\n\n**2015:**\n\nRenewable energy, Frustration-Free Packaging, Career Choice, Leave Share, and Ramp Back are examples of a culture that embraces invention and long-term thinking. It’s very energizing to think that our scale provides opportunities to create impact in these areas.\n\nI can tell you it’s a great joy for me to get to work every day with a team of such smart, imaginative, and passionate people.\n\nIt’s still Day 1\n\n**2016:**\n\nSo, have you settled only for decision quality, or are you mindful of decision velocity too? Are the world’s trends tailwinds for you? Are you falling prey to proxies, or do they serve you? And most important of all, are you delighting customers? We can have the scope and capabilities of a large company and the spirit and heart of a small one. But we have to choose it.\n\nA huge thank-you to each and every customer for allowing us to serve you, to our shareowners for your support, and to Amazonians everywhere for your hard work, your ingenuity, and your passion.\n\nIt remains Day 1.\n\n**2017:**\n\nThis year marks the twentieth anniversary of our first shareholder letter, and our core values and approach remain unchanged. We continue to aspire to be Earth’s most customer-centric company, and we recognize this to be no small or easy challenge. We know there is much we can do better, and we find tremendous energy in the many challenges and opportunities that lie ahead.\n\nA huge thank-you to each and every customer for allowing us to serve you, to our shareowners for your support, and to Amazonians everywhere for your ingenuity, your passion, and your high standards.\n\nIt remains Day 1.\n\n**2018:**\n\nOur investments are not limited to our current employees or even to the present. To train tomorrow’s workforce, we have pledged $50 million, including through our recently announced Amazon Future Engineer program, to support STEM and CS education around the country for elementary, high school, and university students, with a particular focus on attracting more girls and minorities to these professions. We also continue to take advantage of the incredible talents of our veterans. We are well on our way to meeting our pledge to hire twenty-five thousand veterans and military spouses by 2021. And through the Amazon Technical Veterans Apprenticeship program, we are providing veterans on-the-job training in fields like cloud computing.\n\nA huge thank-you to our customers for allowing us to serve you while always challenging us to do even better, to our shareowners for your continuing support, and to all our employees worldwide for your hard work and pioneering spirit. Teams all across Amazon are listening to customers and wandering on their behalf!\n\nIt remains Day 1.\n\n**2019:**\n\nFor now, my own time and thinking continues to be focused on COVID-19 and how Amazon can help while we’re in the middle of it. I am extremely grateful to my fellow Amazonians for all the grit and ingenuity they are showing as we move through this. You can count on all of us to look beyond the immediate crisis for insights and lessons and how to apply them going forward.\n\nReflect on this from Theodor Seuss Geisel: “When something bad happens you have three choices. You can either let it define you, let it destroy you, or you can let it strengthen you.”\n\nI am very optimistic about which of these civilization is going to choose.\n\nEven in these circumstances, it remains Day 1.\n\n**2020:**\n\nAs always, I attach our [1997 shareholder letter](https://media.corporate-ir.net/media_files/irol/97/97664/reports/Shareholderletter97.pdf). It concluded with this: “We at Amazon.com are grateful to our customers for their business and trust, to each other for our hard work, and to our shareholders for their support and encouragement.” That hasn’t changed a bit. I want to especially thank Andy Jassy for agreeing to take on the CEO role. It’s a hard job with a lot of responsibility. Andy is brilliant and has the highest of high standards. I guarantee you that Andy won’t let the universe make us typical. He will muster the energy needed to keep alive in us what makes us special. That won’t be easy, but it is critical. I also predict it will be satisfying and oftentimes fun. Thank you, Andy.\n\nTo all of you: be kind, be original, create more than you consume, and never, never, never let the universe smooth you into your surroundings. It remains Day 1.\n","id":"a3a6bfff-14b0-4506-8910-fb820d3aa59a"},"33":{"slug":"the-cac-cheatsheet","title":"The CAC Cheatsheet","shortTitle":"The CAC Cheatsheet","description":"","tags":"","heroImage":"","createdAt":"2023-02-12","content":"**CAC — Cost of Acquiring a Customer — is the amount of money that you spend on acquring**\n\n-   **ONE**\n    \n-   **Paying**\n    \n-   **Customer**\n    \n\nCAC\n---\n\n> Helps you calculate profitability at a unit level - one customer.

And yet, I am posting it. A typo _hare_, _an_ grammatical error there, an out*,* of place comma, or a sentence fragment that. Irritates you. And, yet I am posting it. Maybe the arrangement of the sentences is off, or maybe the paragraphs are out of order, or maybe - the examples, the analogies, and the metaphors - don’t hit. And yet I am posting this draft.\n\nThe last draft I posted, had the same issues, and yet I posted that, and the one before that. They are live on the internet, for all of you to read. The errors bother me, and I know that they bother you, and yet they are alive on the internet, they are flawed, but they live. This draft explains why.\n\n## The Death of a Draft\n\nWhen I first started writing, I wanted my posts to be perfect. So, after I wrote a draft, I rewrote it, and then I rewrote it; if I didn’t like it, I would delete it; if I didn’t delete it, it sat unpublished, for months, sometimes years, waiting patiently for its uneventful demise. The road was so long that most of the drafts didn’t make it.\n\nFirst came all the manual cleaning up — I re-read my draft and fixed all the obvious objective errors - the grammar, the typos, the punctuation, etc. Then came the cleaning up with apps like Ginger or Grammarly. And then, whenever I could, I asked people to peer-review my draft. This 3-step process took more time than actually writing the draft, but this was only the beginning.\n\nAfter all the obvious objective errors were fixed, the real pain started. Every time I re-read my draft, I ended up rearranging the sentences and paragraphs. On some days one arrangement looked good, and the next time I read it, maybe a week later, the same arrangement looked awful. How do I fix that? Should I go with the first arrangement or the second?\n\nThe pain just kept piling on. Every time I learned something new about writing clearly, I felt an obligation to change the draft. Let’s say I learned somewhere that passive voice should not be used I should use active voice. Now, should I spend time refactoring my post and removing all passives? Maybe I should, maybe I shouldn’t.\n\nDilemmas. Dilemmas. And more dilemmas. What about logical correctness? What about factual accuracy? What about _pick your poison_?\n\nThe dilemmas led to delays and the delays to a dreadful death of the draft.\n\n## The Strangulation of Desire\n\nIn my head, the road to posting started with a first draft and reached a state called a final draft. Posting was just a mechanical formality, a click of a button. The goal was to reach this state of final draft - a writer’s nirvana. I was wrong.\n\nI think the desire to write is directly linked to the dopamine hits of writing, closely followed by dopamine hits of posting. Translation: I want to write more because I feel ‘great’ when I write and I feel ‘good’ when I post. What this means is the more I write and post, the more I tend to write and post in the future.\n\nThe dopamine hit that I get due to writing is highest when I write the first draft, but by the time I come back to it, the hit is cut by half. The farther I get from the first draft, the lower the hit gets. Before I know it, I lose the desire to get to the final draft, and off I go to grab a greater dopamine hit from another ‘first draft’ that I started. The final draft always seems so close, and yet I never get there.\n\nThis feels great in the short term, however, in the long term, it is depressing. After days of jumping from one draft to another, the reflective self kicks in and I ask myself - What have you produced in the last few months? How many posts have you completed? Zero, Zilch, Nada.\n\nAnd, how many corpses, gassed by delays, lie rotting in this mass grave - this folder that you call “Drafts”? How many of them are ready - final? Soon, the thoughts spiral out of control - Why can’t I finish what I started? Should I even be writing? Maybe I shouldn’t. Can I write? Maybe I can’t.\n\nThe pain piles up, first slowly, then suddenly, and soon it overpowers the pleasure of writing. The mass death of drafts slowly strangulates the desire to write.\n\n## The Final Draft\n\nIf you think of the process of writing like a journey through the desert, then the final draft is the mirage of an Oasis - it does not exist and it will kill you if you chase it.\n\nThere was a time when the phrase ‘final draft’ meant something. It was the state of your draft before it was sent for publishing. There was a clear demarcation between the final draft and all the other drafts. It was final in the sense that after that stage, it literally could not be changed.\n\nThe machines roared, the type casts slathered with ink forcefully struck thin sheets of wood called paper and demarcated the final draft from a published post. The inability to change marked clear boundaries between a draft and a final draft.\n\nThat demarcation is long dead.\n\nMost of us no longer publish in print. We publish on the web. And, on the web, drafts just go from being private to public. There is never any finality to them, they are in constant flux. The concept of something being final makes no sense.\n\nEach draft that you make, can be the final draft if you want it to be. You can publish whatever you want, in whatever state it is in. The best part, you can keep changing it and improving it for the rest of your life, even after it’s published.\n\nBut how to decide, what is worthy enough to put out in the world?\n\n## Incomplete - Imperfect - Alive\n\nTo me, writing, like speaking, is just a medium for communicating my thoughts and ideas. To mere mortals like me, the art of writing has become secondary, and the utility of writing - the primary objective.\n\nI still appreciate and aspire towards style but I think, writing that is ugly, imperfect, and alive is always better than writing that is beautiful, abandoned, and dead.\n\nI also read somewhere, “the only form of writing is rewriting”, I agree, but not at the cost of killing someone’s desire to write, to communicate, to say what they think.\n\nI believe, that if you think that you have something worth sharing, share it, and if you think that writing is the best form of communication suited to it, write it. Maybe, just maybe, someone out there likes your thoughts for what they are. Maybe they find it interesting. Maybe they are brilliant. Maybe they are so brilliant that people just ignore the mistakes that you have made. Without giving your writing, life, they will never know, and you will never know.\n\nPeople can, and will point out the mistakes - syntactical or logical. Some people will even embarrass you when they point out the obvious errors that you have made. That’s just the part of the game. That’s how you learn.\n","id":"6ce04190-7070-45bb-b576-dc46e3744513"},"35":{"slug":"the-metadata-of-learning-797","title":"The Metadata of Learning","shortTitle":"The Metadata of Learning","description":"","tags":"","heroImage":"","createdAt":"2022-10-22","content":"I picked up Daniel Kahneman's Thinking Fast and Slow, some 5-6 years ago. Reading the book was a magical experience. It blew my mind and I kept telling people about it (I am doing it right now).\n\nHowever, once the reading was done and the book went back on the bookshelf, it just sat there for a couple of years. After a couple of years, I stumbled on Thaler's Misbehaving, a book that mentioned Kahneman a lot. The same happened when I read books by Dan Ariely or by Nassim Taleb. I picked up Kahneman again and a framework of sorts started developing in my mind about the organization of Kahneman's thoughts. Here are a few nodes of the framework:\n\n-   I figured out he (and, his friend Amos) pioneered the field of Behavioural Economics that had a shot of shifting the current economic paradigm.\n    \n-   I figured out that he talks about heuristics and biases a lot. I knew they were two terms and that they were connected, but wasn't quite sure how exactly.\n    \n-   I figured out that he used the experimental techniques of behavioral psychology to judge how they made choices and judgments. In other words, instead of assuming that people would act logically, he judged them on their actions and their behavior.\n    \n-   I learned a lot of words like Anchoring, Affect, Two Systems, Prospect theory, etc.\n    \n-   I also learned that he has a theory of \"Two-selves\" that he talks about in the final part of the book.\n    \n\nThese nodes of thought existed in my mind but they remained majorly disconnected. They lacked any interlinking or context. That is, I did not know how they connected with each other or, how Khaneman's thoughts fit in the wider cluster of ideas in the world. I lacked the metadata of my learning. Metadata of learning is learning more about the topic, not the topic itself.\n\nWithout metadata, I could not optimally utilize and grow these ideas. In simple words, without the metadata, I couldn't understand Kahneman better. The nodes of thought about Kahneman kept floating aimlessly in the ocean of my mind, occasionally popping out in conversations.\n\n\"That's Availability Bias\" I would spontaneously say either in a conversation or while reading an article. \"But people don't act rationally, economics doesn't work\" I would say when I saw people making plans.\n\nBut on the whole, if you asked me 3 more questions or even examples about the bias I just spoke about, there was nothing to say. There was no unifying structure in my learning of Kahneman. Questions like these kept popping up:\n\n-   Where does Khanemen fit in economics, in psychology, in social sciences?\n    \n-   What are the general patterns of his thoughts?\n    \n-   How do his theories connect with each other?\n    \n-   What theories existed before Kahneman? Where do Kahneman's theories fit?\n    \n-   Who are the critics of Kahneman? etc.\n    \n\nThese questions demanded that I learn the metadata of learning.\n\nMetadata of Kahneman's Thinking Fast and Slow\n---------------------------------------------\n\nIn my learning of Kahneman, the process of metadata collection happened organically. Over several years I figured out the answers to most of these questions one by one.\n\n### Here is the current metadata model of my understanding of Kahneman.\n\nMajorly, there are three types of theories in the world\n\n1.  Normative theories: Explain how things should happen ideally.\n    \n2.  Descriptive Theories: Explain how things actually happen in the real world.\n    \n3.  Prescriptive Theories: Explain how to get from real to ideal. These are prescriptions.\n    \n\nCurrent Economics is a normative theory called Expected Utility Theory. According to this, humans make choices rationally.\n\nKahneman experimented on real people and created a Descriptive theory of economics that explains how humans actually make choices in the real world. This theory is called the Prospect theory.\n\nWhile doing his work on human behavior, he also found that humans use shortcuts to make choices. These shortcuts are called heuristics. These shortcuts ie, heuristics are mostly useful but sometimes lead to systematic errors in thinking called biases. Most of the biases in human behavior can be explained by underlying heuristics.\n\nTo explain the \"Why\" of this theory, he created a System 1 and System 2 model of human behavior. This is almost a prescriptive theory.\n\nAlso sometime in the 1990s, he started work on 'happiness', asking the question, \"What makes people happy in the long term?\". This happiness research led to the creation of the \"Two-selves\" model of how people perceive pain and happiness.\n\nSo coming back to Thinking Fast and Slow. It is essentially 2 books in one.\n\nBook 1: Choice Theories of Kahneman\n\nBook 2: Happiness Theories of Kahneman\n\nMapping these books to the actual table of contents of the book, the following structure emerges.\n\nIn italics is the metadata I have inserted. In bold are the actual contents.\n\n_Book 1: Choice Theories of Kahneman_\n\n-   **Part 1: Two Systems:** _Explanation of irrationality._\n    \n-   **Part 2: Heuristics and Biases**: work on systematic irrationality.\n    \n-   **Part 3: Overconfidence**: the reason why current probabilistic models are not followed.\n    \n-   **Part 4: Choices**: Kahneman's theory of choices.\n    \n\n_Book 2: Happiness Theories of Kahneman_\n\n-   **Part 5: Two Selves**: an exploration of happiness theories.\n    \n\nThe Use of Metadata for Learning Better, More\n---------------------------------------------\n\nOnce I structured my learning with the essential metadata, I could now extend my thought about Kahneman.\n\nFor example, I could ask questions like:\n\n-   Is the two-systems approach the only explanation for irrationality?\n    \n-   Can biases exist without heuristics?\n    \n-   Are there any alternate descriptive theories of economics?\n    \n-   What do the critics of Behavioural Economics say about it?\n    \n-   Is there more work being done in happiness research?\n    \n\n### Over time, these questions and metadata led me to the learning:\n\n-   Utility Theory, Utilitarianism.\n    \n-   The concept of Flow (A part of happiness research)\n    \n-   Gerd Gigerenzer and Nassim Taleb's critiques of Behavioural economics\n    \n-   Richard Thaler's work in Behavioural Economics\n    \n-   Taleb's critique of Thaler's work\n    \n-   ... and many more ideas.\n    \n\nThis made my learning process a lot better and I ended up learning a lot more ideas.\n\nThe Use of Metadata for Learning Faster\n---------------------------------------\n\nThe title of the post also includes the word faster. Till now, this whole process seems slow. How does this make learning faster?\n\nLearning grows exponentially. In other words, the speed of your learning a topic depends on the content of your current learning of that topic. Collecting metadata doesn't just help you learn better, it also makes future learning faster. The metadata lays a solid foundation for learning more on the same topic.\n\nIn Kahneman's case, after I was done collecting the metadata, it cut my learning time for other behavioral economics books by up to 50%. For instance, I could read books like Nudge, Predictably Irrational, and Happiness by Design, ... faster.\n\nA major portion of a book, even Kahneman's book, is just the setup that gets you ready for the Punchline. Collecting the metadata eliminates the process of reading the setup again and again.\n\nFrom Chance to Design\n---------------------\n\nIn the case of Kahneman, the whole process of metadata collection happened organically, by chance. I went where my curiosity led me and discovered more.\n\nHowever, I think that it is easy to learn this way, by design. It might seem overkill in the short term, but if your aim is to truly understand or learn something, this process will save hundreds of hours of your time.\n","id":"05ae739e-086a-450f-ac41-5129d5870de0"},"36":{"slug":"the-philosophy-of-jeff-bezos-part","title":"The Philosophy of Jeff Bezos | Part 1","shortTitle":"The Philosophy of Jeff Bezos | Part 1","description":"","tags":"","heroImage":"","createdAt":"2021-05-07","content":"\n![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F94907753-bd22-469a-b85d-de31c2ee0f0e_1079x720.jpeg)\n\n[Originally Published on May 8, 2021](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-bezos-captained-his-ship-from-1997-2000-jeff-prashant-bhudwal/)\n\n## Preface\n\nThis post is a part of a game that I am playing with myself.\n\nI always wanted to read the annual letters that Jeff Bezos has written to his shareholders over the years. Yesterday, I finally decided to pick them up and read. Soon a few things were very clear to me. One, Bezos is a genius - his letters are profound, his thoughts prophetic, and his words crystal. Sun Tzu would be proud.\n\nTwo, by the letter number three, noise starts taking over the signal and letters start becoming boring. At the end of the day, these are shareholder letters, and even with a brilliant writer like Bezos, shareholder letters can be very boring. I think this is due to two reasons. First, there are numbers and terms that make little sense if you are not well-versed with Amazon as a business and the time during which each letter was written. Second, a lot of this content is irrelevant to people like me, who are not operating in the e-commerce space.\n\nSo, this post is my attempt to make the task of reading these letters less boring, for me and for you. I am gamifying the task by setting myself a goal of filtering all the relevant content from the letters and categorizing them into different themes. There are 23 letters in total and I plan to synthesize them within a week. This game will make it less boring for me.\n\nI will do it all in a series of 6 posts. I will split the 23 letters across the first five posts and the sixth and final post will be a categorized compilation of all the letters along with my annotations for more context. I hope this will make it less boring for you too.\n\n```\n1997 - 2000\n```\n\n## On Long-Term Thinking\n\nIt’s All About the Long Term...We believe that a fundamental measure of our success will be the shareholder value we create over the long term...1997\n\nBecause of our emphasis on the long term, we may make decisions and weigh trade-offs differently than some companies. ...1997\n\nWe plan to invest aggressively to build the foundation for a multi-billion-dollar revenue company serving tens of millions of customers with operational excellence and high efficiency. Although this level of forward investment is costly and carries many inherent risks, we believe it will provide the best end-to-end experience for customers, and actually offer the least risky long-term value creation approach for investors...1998\n\nI invite you to please read the section titled “It’s All About the Long Term.”\\* You might want to read it twice to make sure we’re the kind of company you want to be invested in. As it says there, we don’t claim it’s the right philosophy, we just claim it’s ours!...1998\n\n_Editor's note: The philosophy from \"It's All About the Long Term\" can be found in its entirety in the last section of this post._\n\nOUCH. IT’S BEEN a brutal year for many in the capital markets and certainly for Amazon.com shareholders...So, if the company is better positioned today than it was a year ago, why is the stock price so much lower than it was a year ago? As the famed investor Benjamin Graham said, “In the short term, the stock market is a voting machine; in the long term, it’s a weighing machine.”...2000\n\n_Editor's note: 2000 was when the internet bubble burst. The stock market crashed, people couldn't raise any money for their businesses and as a result, many companies, mainly internet companies, went out of business. Amazon also took a hit as it lost money when the companies it had invested in, went bust._\n\n## On Customers\n\nFrom the beginning, our focus has been on offering our customers compelling value...We dramatically lowered prices, further increasing customer value. Word of mouth remains the most powerful customer acquisition tool we have, and we are grateful for the trust our customers have placed in us...1997\n\nWe intend to build the world’s most customer-centric company...Our customers tell us that they choose Amazon.com and tell their friends about us because of the selection, ease-of-use, low prices, and service that we deliver....1998\n\nI constantly remind our employees to be afraid, to wake up every morning terrified. Not of our competition, but of our customers. Our customers have made our business what it is, they are the ones with whom we have a relationship, and they are the ones to whom we owe a great obligation...1998\n\nOur vision is to use this platform to build Earth’s most customer-centric company,...We’ll listen to customers, invent on their behalf, and personalize the store for each of them, all while working hard to continue to earn their trust...1999\n\n## **On Hiring**\n\nIt’s not easy to work here (when I interview people I tell them, “You can work long, hard, or smart, but at Amazon.com you can’t choose two out of three”), but we are working to build something important, something that matters to our customers, something that we can all tell our grandchildren about. Such things aren’t meant to be easy. ...1997\n\n...We love to be pioneers, it’s in the DNA of the company, and it’s a good thing, too, because we’ll need that pioneering spirit to succeed. We’re proud of the differentiation we’ve built through constant innovation and relentless focus on customer experience...1998\n\nSetting the bar high in our approach to hiring has been, and will continue to be, the single most important element of Amazon.com’s success....1998\n\nDuring our hiring meetings, we ask people to consider three questions before making a decision:\n\n- Will you admire this person?...I’ve always tried hard to work only with people I admire, and I encourage folks here to be just as demanding. Life is definitely too short to do otherwise.\n- Will this person raise the average level of effectiveness of the group they’re entering? We want to fight entropy. The bar has to continuously go up.\n- Along what dimension might this person be a superstar? Many people have unique skills, interests, and perspectives that enrich the work environment for all of us....1998\n\n## On Risk Taking\n\n... we think the opportunities and risks ahead of us are even greater than those behind us. We will have to make many conscious and deliberate choices, some of which will be bold and unconventional. Hopefully, some will turn out to be winners. Certainly, some will turn out to be mistakes....1998\n\n## On Technology\n\n...the current online shopping experience is the worst it will ever be. It’s good enough today to attract seventeen million customers, but it will get so much better...We have a market-size unconstrained opportunity in an area where the underlying foundational technology we employ improves every day. That is not normal....1999\n\n_Editor's note: This is probably true for every revolutionary technology._\n\n## Appendix:\n\n### It's all about the long term...1997\n\n...we want to share with you our fundamental management and decision-making approach so that you, our shareholders, may confirm that it is consistent with your investment philosophy:\n\n- We will continue to focus relentlessly on our customers.\n- We will continue to make investment decisions in light of long-term market leadership considerations rather than short-term profitability considerations or short-term Wall Street reactions.\n- We will continue to measure our programs and the effectiveness of our investments analytically, to jettison those that do not provide acceptable returns, and to step up our investment in those that work best. We will continue to learn from both our successes and our failures.\n- We will make bold rather than timid investment decisions where we see a sufficient probability of gaining market leadership advantages. Some of these investments will pay off, others will not, and we will have learned another valuable lesson in either case.\n- When forced to choose between optimizing the appearance of our GAAP accounting and maximizing the present value of future cash flows, we’ll take the cash flows.\n- We will share our strategic thought processes with you when we make bold choices (to the extent competitive pressures allow), so that you may evaluate for yourselves whether we are making rational long-term leadership investments.\n- We will work hard to spend wisely and maintain our lean culture. We understand the importance of continually reinforcing a cost-conscious culture, particularly in a business incurring net losses.\n- We will balance our focus on growth with emphasis on long-term profitability and capital management. At this stage, we choose to prioritize growth because we believe that scale is central to achieving the potential of our business model.\n- We will continue to focus on hiring and retaining versatile and talented employees and continue to weight their compensation to stock options rather than cash. We know our success will be largely affected by our ability to attract and retain a motivated employee base, each of whom must think like, and therefore must actually be, an owner.\n- We aren’t so bold as to claim that the above is the “right” investment philosophy, but it’s ours, and we would be remiss if we weren’t clear in the approach we have taken and will continue to take.\n","id":"24145907-ccb4-42ab-8d4c-19e281218f7e"},"37":{"slug":"the-philosophy-of-jeff-bezos-part-0bb","title":"The Philosophy of Jeff Bezos | Part 2","shortTitle":"The Philosophy of Jeff Bezos | Part 2","description":"","tags":"","heroImage":"","createdAt":"2021-05-07","content":"\n[Originally Published on May 8, 2021](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-bezos-captained-his-ship-from-2001-2005-jeff-part-bhudwal/)\n\n![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbc817fef-e6e9-4fa2-a4df-1d129c252bc4_1080x720.jpeg)\n\nThis is the second of six posts in the series that maps out Jeff's philosophy in his own words. In short, this particular post is the thematic compilation of the most interesting ideas from the shareholder letters written by Bezos from 2001 to 2005. To understand more about the series and my reasons behind writing it, read the preface from [Part 1 of this series.](https://open.substack.com/pub/ideabox/p/the-philosophy-of-jeff-bezos-part?r=2pw9o&utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web)\n\n```\n2001 - 2005\n```\n\n## On the Economics of Amazon\n\n_Editor's Note: While reading the last few letters I have realised that I will have to do another post explaining the economics of Amazon using Jeff's quotes. Quotes alone will be insufficient for people with limited knowledge of terms like future cashflows, GAAP accounting and EPS ratio. I will write it at the end of this series. However, if you do understand these terms, you can read the letter from 2004 and that will be enough to understand the core of Amazon's economic logic._\n\n_In the meantime, I have chosen to include this section as there are many quotes that are context-independent and self-explanatory._\n\nFocus on cost improvement makes it possible for us to afford to lower prices, which drives growth. Growth spreads fixed costs across more sales, reducing cost per unit, which makes possible more price reductions. Customers like this, and it’s good for shareholders. Please expect us to repeat this loop...2001\n\nSince we expect to keep our fixed costs largely fixed, even at significantly higher unit volumes, we believe Amazon.com is poised over the coming years to generate meaningful, sustained, free cash flow...2001\n\nOne of our most exciting peculiarities is poorly understood. People see that we’re determined to offer both world-leading customer experience _and_ the lowest possible prices, but to some this dual goal seems paradoxical if not downright quixotic...We believe our ability to lower prices and simultaneously drive customer experience is a big deal, and this past year offers evidence that the strategy is working...2002\n\nOur pricing objective is not to discount a small number of products for a limited period of time, but to offer low prices every day and apply them broadly across our entire product range...2002\n\nIncreased volumes take time to materialize, and price reductions almost always hurt current results. In the long term, however, relentlessly driving the “price-cost structure loop” will leave us with a stronger, more valuable business...2003\n\nOur _judgment_ is that relentlessly returning efficiency improvements and scale economies to customers in the form of lower prices creates a virtuous cycle that leads over the long term to a much larger dollar amount of free cash flow, and thereby to a much more valuable Amazon.com...2005\n\n## On Customers\n\nAmazon.com had been primarily built on two pillars of customer experience: selection and convenience...we added a third customer experience pillar: relentlessly lowering prices...2001\n\nOur pricing strategy does not attempt to maximize margin _percentages_, but instead seeks to drive maximum value for customers and thereby create a much larger bottom line—in the long term...2003\n\nAs I’ve discussed many times before, we are firm believers that the long-term interests of shareholders are tightly linked to the interests of our customers: if we do our jobs right, today’s customers will buy more tomorrow, we’ll add more customers in the process, and it will all add up to more cash flow and more long-term value for our shareholders...2001\n\nAt Amazon.com, we use the term customer experience broadly. It includes every customer-facing aspect of our business—from our product prices to our selection, from our website’s user interface to how we package and ship items. The customer experience we create is by far the most important driver of our business...2003\n\nAs we design our customer experience, we do so with long-term owners in mind. We try to make all of our customer experience decisions—big and small—in that framework...2003\n\nI know I’ve sometimes changed my mind before making purchases on Amazon.com as a result of negative or lukewarm customer reviews. Though negative reviews cost us some sales in the short term, helping customers make better purchase decisions ultimately pays off for the company...2003\n\nAgain this year, the widely followed American Customer Satisfaction Index gave Amazon.com a score of eighty-eight—the highest customer satisfaction score ever recorded in any service industry, online or off. A representative of the ACSI was quoted as saying, “If they go any higher, they will get a nosebleed.” We’re working on that...2003\n\nOur buyers pointed out that inviting third parties onto Amazon.com would make inventory forecasting more difficult and that we could get “stuck” with excess inventory if we “lost the detail page” to one of our third-party sellers. However, our judgment was simple. If a third party could offer a better price or better availability on a particular item, then we wanted our customer to get easy access to that offer...2005\n\nYou can count on us to combine a strong quantitative and analytical culture with a willingness to make bold decisions. As we do so, we’ll start with the customer and work backward. In our judgment, that is the best way to create shareholder value...2005\n\n_Editor's note: 'we’ll start with the customer and work backward' is a great summary of Amazon's core philosophy relating to customers._\n\n## On Mistakes and Errors\n\nI’ll just point out that one of the most important things we’ve done to improve convenience and experience for customers also happens to be a huge driver of variable cost productivity: eliminating mistakes and errors at their root. Every year that’s gone by since Amazon.com’s founding, we’ve done a better and better job of eliminating errors, and this past year was our best ever. Eliminating the root causes of errors saves us money and saves customers time...2001\n\n## On Long-Term Thinking\n\n_Editor's Note: Read the 1997 letter again. This is what Bezos says year after year, in every letter. Literally, in every single letter. That letter maps the philosophy of long term thinking in a set of bullet points. Bezos reiterates this philosophy in different ways, with different examples, but the core remains the same. You can find it in the [appendix of post one of this series](https://open.substack.com/pub/ideabox/p/the-philosophy-of-jeff-bezos-part?r=2pw9o&utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web)._\n\n...many investors are effectively short-term tenants, turning their portfolios so quickly they are really just renting the stocks that they temporarily “own.”...2003\n\n## On Decision Making\n\nMany of the important decisions we make at Amazon.com can be made with data. There is a right answer or a wrong answer, a better answer or a worse answer, and math tells us which is which. These are our favorite kinds of decisions...Quantitative analysis improves the customer’s experience and our cost structure...2005\n\n...decisions require us to make some assumptions and judgments, but in such decisions, judgment and opinion come into play only as junior partners. The heavy lifting is done by the math...2005\n\nhowever, not all of our important decisions can be made in this enviable, math-based way. Sometimes we have little or no historical data to guide us and proactive experimentation is impossible, impractical, or tantamount to a decision to proceed. Though data, analysis, and math play a role, the prime ingredient in these decisions is judgment...2005\n\nMath-based decisions command wide agreement, whereas judgment-based decisions are rightly debated and often controversial, at least until put into practice and demonstrated. Any institution unwilling to endure controversy must limit itself to decisions of the first type. In our view, doing so would not only limit controversy—it would also significantly limit innovation and long-term value creation...2005\n\nThe foundation of our decision-making philosophy was laid out in our 1997 letter to shareholders...2005\n\n_Editor's Note: Read the previous note._\n","id":"c6b97f5a-6668-4774-9408-73aa9d19bd13"},"38":{"slug":"the-philosophy-of-jeff-bezos-part-27b","title":"The Philosophy of Jeff Bezos | Part 5","shortTitle":"The Philosophy of Jeff Bezos | Part 5","description":"","tags":"","heroImage":"","createdAt":"2021-06-01","content":"\n[Originally Published on June 2, 2021](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-bezos-captained-his-ship-from-2016-2020-jeff-part-bhudwal/)\n\n![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1fe20069-e7ae-479f-ab90-bfe1c1daf462_1008x720.jpeg)\n\nThis is the fifth of six posts in the series that maps out Jeff's philosophy in his own words. In short, this particular post is the thematic compilation of the most interesting ideas from the **shareholder letters written by Bezos from 2016 to 2020**. To understand more about the series and my reasons behind writing it, read the preface from **[Part 1 of this series.](https://ideabox.substack.com/p/the-philosophy-of-jeff-bezos-part)**\n\n```\n2016 - 2020\n\n```\n\n_Editor's Note: Letters from 2016, 17, 18 and 20 are incredibly dense. Before 2016, the updates to philosophy ratio for each letter was around 70:30. This flips around in the years that follow. Other than the 2019 letter - which is mostly about COVID-19 - the rest of the letters are packed with Jeff's thoughts, advice and methods. I will try my best to find out the best bits from these letters, but be warned - I will deliberately leave out a lot. [This series is a map](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Map%E2%80%93territory_relation), and therefore its usefulness lies in deliberately leaving out some information and abstracting some other._\n\n## On Strategy for Day 2\n\n“Jeff, what does Day 2 look like? ...“Day 2 is stasis. Followed by irrelevance. Followed by excruciating, painful decline. Followed by death. And _that_ is why it is _always_ Day 1.”...I’m interested in the question “How do you fend off Day 2?” What are the techniques and tactics? How do you keep the vitality of Day 1, even inside a large organization? ...Here’s a starter pack of essentials for Day 1 defense: customer obsession, a skeptical view of proxies, the eager adoption of external trends, and high-velocity decision making....2016\n\nThere are many ways to center a business. You can be competitor focused, you can be product focused, you can be technology focused, you can be business model focused, and there are more. But in my view, obsessive customer focus is by far the most protective of Day 1 vitality...Staying in Day 1 requires you to experiment patiently, accept failures, plant seeds, protect saplings, and double down when you see customer delight. A customer-obsessed culture best creates the conditions where all of that can happen...2016\n\nAs companies get larger and more complex, there’s a tendency to manage to proxies...A common example is process as proxy. Good process serves you so you can serve customers. But if you’re not watchful, the process can become the thing...The process becomes the proxy for the result you want. You stop looking at outcomes and just make sure you’re doing the process right. Gulp. It’s not that rare to hear a junior leader defend a bad outcome with something like, “Well, we followed the process.” ... The process is not the thing...2016\n\nThe outside world can push you into Day 2 if you won’t or can’t embrace powerful trends quickly. If you fight them, you’re probably fighting the future. Embrace them and you have a tailwind...2016\n\nSo, have you settled only for decision quality, or are you mindful of decision velocity too? Are the world’s trends tailwinds for you? Are you falling prey to proxies, or do they serve you? And most important of all, are you delighting customers?...2016\n\n## **On Invention**\n\nGood inventors and designers _deeply_ understand their customer. They spend tremendous energy developing that intuition. They study and understand many anecdotes rather than only the averages you’ll find on surveys. They _live_ with the design.\n\nI’m not against beta testing or surveys. But you, the product or service owner, must understand the customer, have a vision, and love the offering. Then, beta testing and research can help you find your blind spots. A remarkable customer experience starts with heart, intuition, curiosity, play, guts, taste. You won’t find any of it in a survey...2016\n\n## On Decision Making\n\n_Editor's Note: Here are the ideas to help you make high-velocity decisions._\n\nFirst, never use a one-size-fits-all decision-making process. Many decisions are reversible, two-way doors. Those decisions can use a light-weight process. For those, so what if you’re wrong? I wrote about this in more detail in last year’s letter...2016\n\nSecond, most decisions should probably be made with somewhere around 70 percent of the information you wish you had. If you wait for 90 percent, in most cases, you’re probably being slow...2016\n\nThird, use the phrase “disagree and commit.” This phrase will save a lot of time....I disagree and commit all the time. We recently greenlit a particular Amazon Studios original. I told the team my view: debatable whether it would be interesting enough, complicated to produce, the business terms aren’t that good, and we have lots of other opportunities. They had a completely different opinion and wanted to go ahead. I wrote back right away with “I disagree and commit and hope it becomes the most watched thing we’ve ever made.” Consider how much slower this decision cycle would have been if the team had actually had to _convince_ me rather than simply get my commitment...2016\n\nFourth, recognize true _misalignment_ issues early and escalate them _immediately_. Sometimes teams have different objectives and fundamentally different views. They are not aligned. No amount of discussion, no number of meetings will resolve that deep misalignment. Without escalation, the default dispute resolution mechanism for this scenario is exhaustion. Whoever has more stamina carries the decision...2016\n\n## On Building a Culture of High Standards\n\n_Editor's Note: The 2017 letter is an essay on building a culture of high standards. Taking out excerpts from this letter and categorising them was impossible. So, I wrote a post that could stand independently. It is a shortened and annotated version of the letter. Here is a link to it._\n\n## On Hiring\n\nFrom very early on in Amazon’s life, we knew we wanted to create a culture of builders—people who are curious, explorers.\n\n- They like to invent.\n- Even when they’re experts, they are “fresh” with a beginner’s mind.\n- A builder’s mentality helps us approach big, hard-to-solve opportunities with a humble conviction that success can come through iteration: invent, launch, reinvent, relaunch, start over, rinse, repeat, again and again.\n- They know the path to success is anything but straight...2018\n\n_Editor's Note: At this point, it would be helpful to do a google search for 'non-linearity', 'design thinking', and 'power laws'._\n\n## On Invention\n\nSometimes (often actually) in business, you do know where you’re going, and when you do, you can be efficient. Put in place a plan and execute...Wandering is an essential counterbalance to efficiency. You need to employ both. The outsized discoveries—the “nonlinear” ones—are highly likely to require wandering...2018\n\nThe biggest needle movers will be things that customers don’t know to ask for. We must invent on their behalf. We have to tap into our own inner imagination about what’s possible...No one asked for AWS. No one...No customer was asking for Echo... If you had gone to a customer in 2013 and said “Would you like a black, always-on cylinder in your kitchen about the size of a Pringles can that you can talk to and ask questions, that also turns on your lights and plays music?” I guarantee you they’d have looked at you strangely and said, “No, thank you.”...2018\n\nAs a company grows, everything needs to scale, including the size of your failed experiments. If the size of your failures isn’t growing, you’re not going to be inventing at a size that can actually move the needle...a single big winning bet can more than cover the cost of many losers...2018\n\n## On Covid & 19\n\n_Editor's Note: The 2019 letter is 80 per cent Covid, and 20 per cent company updates. There is no direct active philosophizing. So, I have decided to skip the letter. If you are interested, [here is the link to the letter](https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/company-news/2019-letter-to-shareholders#:~:text=To%20our%20shareowners%3A,customers%20through%20this%20difficult%20time.)._\n\n## On Success\n\nIf you want to be successful in business (in life, actually), you have to create more than you consume. Your goal should be to create value for everyone you interact with...2020\n\n## Jeff's Final Word\n\n_Editor's Note: On July 5, 2021, Jeff stepped down as Amazon's CEO. The same day on which he incorporated Amazon exactly 27 years ago. So, the 2020 letter was Jeff's final letter. Here is the best part of that letter in full._\n\n### **Differentiation is Survival and the Universe Wants You to be Typical**\n\nThis is my last annual shareholder letter as the CEO of Amazon, and I have one last thing of utmost importance I feel compelled to teach. I hope all Amazonians take it to heart.\n\nHere is a passage from Richard Dawkins’ (extraordinary) book The Blind Watchmaker. It’s about a basic fact of biology.\n\n_“Staving off death is a thing that you have to work at. Left to itself – and that is what it is when it dies – the body tends to revert to a state of equilibrium with its environment. If you measure some quantity such as the temperature, the acidity, the water content or the electrical potential in a living body, you will typically find that it is markedly different from the corresponding measure in the surroundings. Our bodies, for instance, are usually hotter than our surroundings, and in cold climates they have to work hard to maintain the differential. When we die the work stops, the temperature differential starts to disappear, and we end up the same temperature as our surroundings. Not all animals work so hard to avoid coming into equilibrium with their surrounding temperature, but all animals do some comparable work. For instance, in a dry country, animals and plants work to maintain the fluid content of their cells, work against a natural tendency for water to flow from them into the dry outside world. If they fail they die. More generally, if living things didn’t work actively to prevent it, they would eventually merge into their surroundings, and cease to exist as autonomous beings. That is what happens when they die.”_\n\nWhile the passage is not intended as a metaphor, it’s nevertheless a fantastic one, and very relevant to Amazon. I would argue that it’s relevant to all companies and all institutions and to each of our individual lives too. In what ways does the world pull at you in an attempt to make you normal? How much work does it take to maintain your distinctiveness? To keep alive the thing or things that make you special?\n\nI know a happily married couple who have a running joke in their relationship. Not infrequently, the husband looks at the wife with faux distress and says to her, “Can’t you just be normal?” They both smile and laugh, and of course the deep truth is that her distinctiveness is something he loves about her. But, at the same time, it’s also true that things would often be easier – take less energy – if we were a little more normal.\n\nThis phenomenon happens at all scale levels. Democracies are not normal. Tyranny is the historical norm. If we stopped doing all of the continuous hard work that is needed to maintain our distinctiveness in that regard, we would quickly come into equilibrium with tyranny.\n\nWe all know that distinctiveness – originality – is valuable. We are all taught to “be yourself.” What I’m really asking you to do is to embrace and be realistic about how much energy it takes to maintain that distinctiveness. The world wants you to be typical – in a thousand ways, it pulls at you. Don’t let it happen.\n\nYou have to pay a price for your distinctiveness, and it’s worth it. The fairy tale version of “be yourself” is that all the pain stops as soon as you allow your distinctiveness to shine. That version is misleading. Being yourself is worth it, but don’t expect it to be easy or free. You’ll have to put energy into it continuously.\n\nThe world will always try to make Amazon more typical – to bring us into equilibrium with our environment. It will take continuous effort, but we can and must be better than that.\n\n```\nEnd\n\n```\n\n## **Epilogue:**\n\n> Hofstadter's Law: It always takes longer than you expect, even when you take into account Hofstadter's Law.\n\nHumans, while providing estimates, are limited by Hofstadter's Law - It always takes longer than you expect, even when you take into account [Hofstadter's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hofstadter%27s_law). Simply stated - **to err in estimation is human.**\n\nIn the first post of this series, I designed a game to trick myself into productivity - reading and synthesizing all of the Amazon shareholder letters in a week. I too, fell victim to Hofstader's Law. One week was a conservative estimate on my end and yet I have already taken triple the time. But I think that the game did what it was supposed to do. I managed to read all the letters in about two weeks and compile them in three. I am glad about that.\n\n### **Mutually Exclusive & Collectively Exhaustive**\n\nAll that is left is creating a concise mega-post about the philosophy of Amazon, with categories and letter excerpts that are mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive. That is, I have to make the categories consistent and remove redundancies of thoughts from the excerpts. I will do that in the next post and that will mark the end of this series. I will try to do that within a couple of weeks. As I write this I can feel Hofstader's Law smirking at me. **But, to be optimistic is human too**.\n\nBeyond the series, there are at least two spinoff posts that I plan to write in the near future based on this series. In the first one, I will explain the economics of Amazon. In the second, I will try to synthesise the Amazon philosophy in less than 200 words. So, watch out for those too.\n","id":"909fe225-657b-484f-be6d-fa902af3845a"},"39":{"slug":"the-philosophy-of-jeff-bezos-part-6e1","title":"The Philosophy of Jeff Bezos | Part 3","shortTitle":"The Philosophy of Jeff Bezos | Part 3","description":"","tags":"","heroImage":"","createdAt":"2021-05-15","content":"\n[Originally Published on May 16, 2021](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-bezos-captained-his-ship-from-2006-2010-jeff-part-bhudwal/)\n\n![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbc722a7d-d5d8-4ca7-a1aa-0a3ddeb0d5f4_960x720.jpeg)\n\nThis is the third of six posts in the series that maps out Jeff's philosophy in his own words. In short, this particular post is the thematic compilation of the most interesting ideas from the shareholder letters written by Bezos from 2006 to 2010. To understand more about the series and my reasons behind writing it, read the preface from **[Part 1 of this series.](https://ideabox.substack.com/p/the-philosophy-of-jeff-bezos-part)**\n\n## **Interlude:** Analysing all the text for patterns.\n\nI ran an experiment where I compiled the text from all the Amazon letter into a text file and then ran a very basic text analysis on this file. Here are the results:\n\n**Most used word:**\n\n1.  Customer(s)\n2.  Amazon\n3.  New\n4.  Year\n5.  Percent\n\nThe word 'customer(s)' is used 2X more than the next most used word 'Amazon'. The following word cloud represents the same fact. The bigger the size of the word, the more it is used.\n\n![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fefbdf474-e893-41c0-bf0b-bd8810f33a0d_624x468.png)\n\n**Most used two-word phrases:**\n\n1.  Long Term\n2.  Customer Experience\n3.  Cash Flow\n4.  High Standards\n\n**Relative frequency of words used in the letters from 1997 - 2019:**\n\n![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7e368313-1c84-42df-9bb5-40707dc0ed1d_640x447.png)\n\nThe words 'new', 'percent' and 'year' appear consistently over the years. In the graph, you can clearly see them forming their own cluster at the bottom. If you consider them as noise, only two words consistently stand out - 'customers' and 'amazon'.\n\nThere are many inferences that can be drawn from these results and what they say about the company. I leave that task with you.\n\nNow back to the compilation.\n\n```\n2006 - 2010\n```\n\n## On Choosing New Businesses\n\nOur established businesses are well-rooted young trees. They are growing, enjoy high returns on capital, and operate in very large market segments. These characteristics set a high bar for any new business we would start. Before we invest our shareholders’ money in a new business, we must convince ourselves that the new opportunity can generate the returns on capital our investors expected when they invested in Amazon. And we must convince ourselves that the new business can grow to a scale where it can be significant in the context of our overall company. Furthermore, we must believe that the opportunity is currently underserved and that we have the capabilities needed to bring strong customer-facing differentiation to the marketplace. Without that, it’s unlikely we’d get to scale in that new business...2006\n\n![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcc75fa7e-b68a-4c44-a192-88a4d6674a26_1920x1080.jpeg)\n\nAs we continue to grow, we’ll work to maintain a culture that embraces new businesses. We won’t always choose right, and we won’t always succeed. But we will be choosy, and we will work hard and patiently...2006\n\nAmazon’s culture is unusually supportive of small businesses with big potential, and I believe that’s a source of competitive advantage...The culture demands that these new businesses be high potential and that they be innovative and differentiated, but it does not demand that they be large on the day that they are born...2006\n\n## On Innovation\n\nWe knew Kindle would have to _get out of the way_, just like a physical book, so readers could become engrossed in the words and forget they’re reading on a device. We also knew we shouldn’t try to copy every last feature of a book—we could never out-book the book. We’d have to add _new_ capabilities—ones that could never be possible with a traditional book...2007\n\nAnytime you make something simpler and lower friction, you get more of it...2007\n\nWe humans coevolve with our tools. We change our tools, and then our tools change us. Writing, invented thousands of years ago, is a grand whopper of a tool, and I have no doubt that it changed us dramatically. Five hundred years ago, Gutenberg’s invention led to a significant step-change in the cost of books. Physical books ushered in a new way of collaborating and learning. Lately, networked tools such as desktop computers, laptops, cell phones and PDAs have changed us too...2007\n\n(_Before Kindle_) Amazon had never designed or built a hardware device, but rather than change the vision to accommodate our then-existing skills, we hired a number of talented (and missionary!) hardware engineers and got started learning a new institutional skill, one that we needed to better serve readers in the future...2008\n\n...while many of our systems are based on the latest in computer science research, this often hasn’t been sufficient: our architects and engineers have had to advance research in directions that no academic had yet taken. Many of the problems we face have no textbook solutions, and so we—happily—invent new approaches...2010\n\nAll the effort we put into technology might not matter that much if we kept technology off to the side in some sort of R&D department, but we don’t take that approach. Technology infuses all of our teams, all of our processes, our decision making, and our approach to innovation in each of our businesses. It is deeply integrated into everything we do...2010\n\nI realize my tone here tends toward the missionary, and I can assure you it’s heartfelt. It’s also not unique to me but is shared by a large group of folks here. I’m glad about that because missionaries build better products...2007\n\n## On Amazon's Strategy\n\nIn this [turbulent global economy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_crisis_of_2007%E2%80%932008), our fundamental approach remains the same. Stay heads down, focused on the long term and obsessed over customers. Long-term thinking levers our existing abilities and lets us do new things we couldn’t otherwise contemplate. It supports the failure and iteration required for invention, and it frees us to pioneer in unexplored spaces. Seek instant gratification—or the elusive promise of it—and chances are you’ll find a crowd there ahead of you. Long-term orientation interacts well with customer obsession. If we can identify a customer need and if we can further develop conviction that that need is meaningful and durable, our approach permits us to work patiently for multiple years to deliver a solution. “Working backward” from customer needs can be contrasted with a “skills-forward” approach where existing skills and competencies are used to drive business opportunities. The skills-forward approach says, “We are really good at X. What else can we do with X?” That’s a useful and rewarding business approach. However, if used exclusively, the company employing it will never be driven to develop fresh skills. Eventually the existing skills will become outmoded. Working backward from customer needs often _demands_ that we acquire new competencies and exercise new muscles, never mind how uncomfortable and awkward-feeling those first steps might be...2008\n\n_Editor's Note: The following is Amazon's customer experience strategy. Amazon's pricing, product selection, and delivery strategies all start from here. The variables are optimised accordingly: Price-->Low, Selection --> Vast, Delivery --> Fast & Convenient._\n\n- In our retail business, we have strong conviction that customers value low prices, vast selection, and fast, convenient delivery and that these needs will remain stable over time. Our belief in the durability of these pillars is what gives us the confidence required to invest in strengthening them...2008\n\n_Editor's Note: The following is Amazon's financial strategy._\n\nOur primary financial goal remains maximising long-term free cash flow and doing so with high rates of return on invested capital...2008\n\n## On Pricing Products\n\n- Our pricing objective is to earn customer trust, not to optimise short-term profit dollars...We may make less per item, but by consistently earning trust we will sell many more items. Therefore, we offer low prices across our entire product range...2008\n\n## On Amazon's Goal Setting Strategy & Process\n\n- Senior leaders that are new to Amazon are often surprised by how little time we spend discussing actual financial results or debating projected financial outputs. To be clear, we take these financial outputs seriously, but we believe that focusing our energy on the controllable inputs to our business is the most effective way to maximize financial outputs over time...2009\n- Our annual goal setting process begins in the fall and concludes early in the new year after we’ve completed our peak holiday quarter. Our goal setting sessions are lengthy, spirited, and detail oriented. We have a high bar for the experience our customers deserve and a sense of urgency to improve that experience. We’ve been using this same annual process for many years...2009\n- For 2010, we have 452 detailed goals with owners, deliverables, and targeted completion dates... None of these goals are easy and many will not be achieved without invention. We review the status of each of these goals several times per year among our senior leadership team and add, remove, and modify goals as we proceed...Taken as a whole, the set of goals is indicative of our fundamental approach. Start with customers and work backward. Listen to customers, but don’t just listen to customers—also invent on their behalf. We can’t assure you that we’ll meet all of this year’s goals. We haven’t in past years. However, we can assure you that we’ll continue to obsess over customers....2009\n","id":"0f88551a-cc70-43c7-9830-a97d4a6739c4"},"40":{"slug":"the-philosophy-of-jeff-bezos-part-d83","title":"The Philosophy of Jeff Bezos | Part 4","shortTitle":"The Philosophy of Jeff Bezos | Part 4","description":"","tags":"","heroImage":"","createdAt":"2021-05-22","content":"\n[Originally Published on May 23, 2021](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-bezos-captained-his-ship-from-2011-2015-jeff-part-bhudwal/)\n\n![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4422163e-b1f0-4a1a-bb4a-6851115f1834_1081x720.jpeg)\n\nThis is the fourth of six posts in the series that maps out Jeff's philosophy in his own words. In short, this particular post is the thematic compilation of the most interesting ideas from the shareholder letters written by Bezos from 2011 to 2015. To understand more about the series and my reasons behind writing it, read the preface from **[Part 1 of this series.](https://ideabox.substack.com/p/the-philosophy-of-jeff-bezos-part)**\n\n## Interlude:\n\nI took a detour while writing this post and wrote another post on Jeff's letters. It is short introduction to how human memory works, followed by a compilation of last two paragraphs from each of his letter from 1997 to 2020.\n\nWhy last two paragraphs? Because to Bezos, and to humans in general, the end matters. You can check out the post if you want to understand the complete reasoning. For now, lets get back to the letters.\n\n```\n2011-2015\n```\n\n## On Innovation\n\nInvention comes in many forms and at many scales. The most radical and transformative of inventions are often those that empower _others_ to unleash _their_ creativity—to pursue _their_ dreams. That’s a big part of what’s going on with Amazon Web Services, Fulfillment by Amazon, and Kindle Direct Publishing...These innovative, large-scale platforms are not zero-sum—they create win-win situations and create significant value for developers, entrepreneurs, customers, authors, and readers...2011\n\nI am emphasizing the self-service nature of these platforms _(Amazon Web Services, Fulfillment by Amazon, and Kindle Direct Publishing)_ because it’s important for a reason I think is somewhat nonobvious: even well-meaning gatekeepers slow innovation. When a platform is self-service, even the improbable ideas can get tried, because there’s no expert gatekeeper ready to say, “That will never work!” And guess what—many of those improbable ideas do work, and society is the beneficiary of that diversity...2011\n\nWe have our own internal experimentation platform called “Weblab” that we use to evaluate improvements to our websites and products. In 2013, we ran 1,976 Weblabs worldwide, up from 1,092 in 2012, and 546 in 2011. One recent success is our new feature called “Ask an Owner.” ... As is the case with reviews, customers are happy to share their knowledge to directly help other customers. Millions of questions have already been asked and answered...2013\n\n...decentralized distribution of invention throughout the company—not limited to the company’s senior leaders—is the only way to get robust, high-throughput innovation. What we’re doing is challenging and fun—we get to work in the future. Failure comes part and parcel with invention. It’s not optional. We understand that and believe in failing early and iterating until we get it right. When this process works, it means our failures are relatively small in size (most experiments can start small), and when we hit on something that is really working for customers, we double-down on it with hopes to turn it into an even bigger success. However, it’s not always as clean as that. Inventing is messy, and over time, it’s certain that we’ll fail at some big bets too...2013\n\nOne area where I think we are especially distinctive is failure. I believe we are the best place in the world to fail (we have plenty of practice!), and failure and invention are inseparable twins. To invent you have to experiment, and if you know in advance that it’s going to work, it’s not an experiment. Most large organizations embrace the idea of invention but are not willing to suffer the string of failed experiments necessary to get there. Outsized returns often come from betting against conventional wisdom, and conventional wisdom is usually right. Given a ten percent chance of a one hundred times payoff, you should take that bet every time. But you’re still going to be wrong nine times out of ten. We all know that if you swing for the fences, you’re going to strike out a lot, but you’re also going to hit some home runs. The difference between baseball and business, however, is that baseball has a truncated outcome distribution. When you swing, no matter how well you connect with the ball, the most runs you can get is four. In business, every once in a while, when you step up to the plate, you can score one thousand runs. This long-tailed distribution of returns is why it’s important to be bold. Big winners pay for so many experiments...2015\n\n## On Strategy\n\nOne advantage—perhaps a somewhat subtle one—of a customer-driven focus is that it aids a certain type of proactivity. When we’re at our best, we don’t wait for external pressures. We are _internally_ driven to improve our services, adding benefits and features, before we have to. We lower prices and increase value for customers before we have to. We invent before we have to. These investments are motivated by customer focus rather than by reaction to competition...2012\n\nOur business approach is to sell premium hardware at roughly breakeven prices. We want to make money when people use our devices—not when people buy our devices. We think this aligns us better with customers. For example, we don’t need our customers to be on the upgrade treadmill. We can be very happy to see people still using four-year-old Kindles!...2012\n\nMarketplace, Prime, and Amazon Web Services are three big ideas. We’re lucky to have them, and we’re determined to improve and nurture them—make them even better for customers. You can also count on us to work hard to find a fourth. We’ve already got a number of candidates in the works, and as we promised some twenty years ago, we’ll continue to make bold bets. With the opportunities unfolding in front of us to serve customers better through invention, we assure you we won’t stop trying...2014\n\nWe want to be a large company that’s also an invention machine. We want to combine the extraordinary customer-serving capabilities that are enabled by size with the speed of movement, nimbleness, and risk-acceptance mentality normally associated with entrepreneurial start-ups...2015\n\n## On Long-Term Thinking\n\nOur heavy investments in Prime, AWS, Kindle, digital media, and customer experience in general strike some as too generous, shareholder indifferent, or even at odds with being a for-profit company. “Amazon, as far as I can tell, is a charitable organization being run by elements of the investment community for the benefit of consumers,” writes one outside observer. But I don’t think so. To me, trying to dole out improvements in a just-in-time fashion would be too clever by half. It would be risky in a world as fast-moving as the one we all live in. More fundamentally, I think long-term thinking squares the circle. Proactively delighting customers earns trust, which earns more business from those customers, even in new business arenas. Take a long-term view, and the interests of customers and shareholders align...2012\n\n## **On Creating Successful Businesses**\n\nA dreamy business offering has at least four characteristics. Customers love it, it can grow to very large size, it has strong returns on capital, and it’s durable in time—with the potential to endure for decades. When you find one of these, don’t just swipe right, get married...Well, I’m pleased to report that Amazon hasn’t been monogamous in this regard...I believe are three such life partners: Marketplace, Prime, and AWS...2014\n\n_(In building AWS, Markteplace and Prime)_ We’ll approach the job with our usual tools: customer obsession rather than competitor focus, heartfelt passion for invention, commitment to operational excellence, and a willingness to think long-term...2014\n\nThey share a distinctive organizational culture that cares deeply about and acts with conviction on a small number of principles. I’m talking about customer obsession rather than competitor obsession, eagerness to invent and pioneer, willingness to fail, the patience to think long-term, and the taking of professional pride in operational excellence...2015\n\n## On Company Culture & Hiring\n\nA word about corporate cultures: for better or for worse, they are enduring, stable, hard to change. They can be a source of advantage or disadvantage. You can write down your corporate culture, but when you do so, you’re discovering it, uncovering it—not creating it. It is created slowly over time by the people and by events—by the stories of past success and failure that become a deep part of the company lore. If it’s a distinctive culture, it will fit certain people like a custom-made glove. The reason cultures are so stable in time is because people self-select. Someone energized by competitive zeal may select and be happy in one culture, while someone who loves to pioneer and invent may choose another. The world, thankfully, is full of many high-performing, highly distinctive corporate cultures. We never claim that our approach is the right one—just that it’s ours—and over the last two decades, we’ve collected a large group of like-minded people. Folks who find our approach energizing and meaningful...2015\n\n## On Decision Making\n\nOne common pitfall for large organizations—one that hurts speed and inventiveness—is “one-size-fits-all” decision making.\n\nSome decisions are consequential and irreversible or nearly irreversible—one-way doors—and these decisions must be made methodically, carefully, slowly, with great deliberation and consultation. If you walk through and don’t like what you see on the other side, you can’t get back to where you were before. We can call these Type 1 decisions. But most decisions aren’t like that—they are changeable, reversible—they’re two-way doors. If you’ve made a suboptimal Type 2 decision, you don’t have to live with the consequences for that long. You can reopen the door and go back through. Type 2 decisions can and should be made quickly by high judgment individuals or small groups.\n\nAs organizations get larger, there seems to be a tendency to use the heavy-weight Type 1 decision-making _process_ on most decisions, including many Type 2 decisions. The end result of this is slowness, unthoughtful risk aversion, failure to experiment sufficiently, and consequently diminished invention.\\* We’ll have to figure out how to fight that tendency.\n\n(\\*The opposite situation is less interesting and there is undoubtedly some survivorship bias. Any companies that habitually use the light-weight Type 2 decision-making process to make Type 1 decisions go extinct before they get large.) ...2015\n\n## Appendix 2: Helpful Links\n\nI think the following links will help you get more out of this compilation.\n\n- [Timeline of Amazon](https://edition.cnn.com/interactive/2018/10/business/amazon-history-timeline/index.html)\n- [History of Amazon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Amazon)\n- [Shareholder Letters](https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/company-news/2020-letter-to-shareholders)\n","id":"26ca0121-bcba-4cdd-91f0-ecef4443e402"},"41":{"slug":"the-secret-sauce-of-amazons-efficiency","title":"The Secret Sauce of Amazon's Efficiency","shortTitle":"The Secret Sauce of Amazon's Efficiency","description":"","tags":"","heroImage":"","createdAt":"2021-05-24","content":"\n[Originally Published on May 25, 2021](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-jeff-bezos-maintains-high-standards-amazon-prashant-bhudwal/)\n\n![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb0bd0939-2ed1-483e-b1bd-1639fabbc057_1075x720.jpeg)\n\n_As I was completing the [series on Amazon's annual shareholder letters](https://ideabox.substack.com/p/the-philosophy-of-jeff-bezos-part), the letter from 2017 stood out. The first part of the 2017 letter is an essay by Jeff Bezos on building a culture with high standards. It is a masterclass on culture building, self-improvement and - at meta-level - strategic thinking. This letter deserved a post of its own._\n\n_My reasoning behind writing this post remains the same as the [original series](https://ideabox.substack.com/p/the-philosophy-of-jeff-bezos-part) - play positive-sum games. I have shortened and annotated the letter so that I can understand it better and I have posted it so that others can save time by reading it faster. Everything written in italics is written by me. These three dots \"...\" (aka. vertical ellipsis) represent the parts that I have omitted._\n\n_**This is for the lazy ones.** If you have some time on your hands, stop here and go read the [letter in its entirety](https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/company-news/2017-letter-to-shareholders). If you don't, read ahead._\n\n## A Culture of High Standards\n\nOne thing I love about customers is that they are divinely discontent. Their expectations are never static—they go up...How do you stay ahead of ever-rising customer expectations? There’s no single way to do it—it’s a combination of many things. But high standards (widely deployed and at all levels of detail) are certainly a big part of it...I’d like to share with you the essentials of what we’ve learned (so far) about high standards inside an organization.\n\n_First, two fundamental questions about high standards._\n\n### **Intrinsic or Teachable?**\n\n...are high standards intrinsic or teachable? I believe high standards are teachable. In fact, people are pretty good at learning high standards simply through exposure. High standards are contagious. Bring a new person onto a high standards team, and they’ll quickly adapt. The opposite is also true. If low standards prevail, those too will quickly spread. And though exposure works well to teach high standards, I believe you can accelerate that rate of learning by articulating a few core principles of high standards, which I hope to share in this letter.\n\n### **Universal or Domain Specific?**\n\n...if you have high standards in one area, do you automatically have high standards elsewhere? I believe high standards are domain specific, and that you have to learn high standards separately in every arena of interest...You can consider yourself a person of high standards in general and still have debilitating blind spots. There can be whole arenas of endeavor where you may not even know that your standards are low or nonexistent, and certainly not world class. It’s critical to be open to that likelihood.\n\n_Now, the steps to achieve high standards in a particular domain._\n\n_Steps 1 and 2:_\n\n### **Recognition and Scope**\n\nFirst, you have to be able to recognize what good looks like in that domain.\n\nSecond, you must have realistic expectations for how hard it should be (how much work it will take) to achieve that result—the scope...Unrealistic beliefs on scope—often hidden and undiscussed—kill high standards. To achieve high standards yourself or as part of a team, you need to form and proactively communicate realistic beliefs about how hard something is going to be—something this coach understood well.\n\nWe don’t do PowerPoint (or any other slide-oriented) presentations at Amazon. Instead, we write narratively structured six-page memos... Often, when a memo isn’t great, it’s not the writer’s inability to recognize the high standard, but instead a wrong expectation on scope: they mistakenly believe a high-standards, six-page memo can be written in one or two days or even a few hours, when really it might take a week or more!... The great memos are written and re-written, shared with colleagues who are asked to improve the work, set aside for a couple of days, and then edited again with a fresh mind. They simply can’t be done in a day or two. The key point here is that you can improve results through the simple act of teaching scope—that a great memo probably should take a week or more.\n\n_Step 3:_\n\n### **Skill**\n\nBeyond recognizing the standard and having realistic expectations on scope, how about skill? Surely to write a world-class memo, you have to be an extremely skilled writer. Is it another required element? In my view, not so much, at least not for the individual in the context of teams. The football coach doesn’t need to be able to throw, and a film director doesn’t need to be able to act. But they both do need to recognize high standards for those things and teach realistic expectations on scope.\n\n### **Benefits of High Standards**\n\n- ...most obviously, you’re going to build better products and services for customers—this would be reason enough!\n- Perhaps a little less obvious: people are drawn to high standards—they help with recruiting and retention.\n- More subtle: a culture of high standards is protective of all the “invisible” but crucial work that goes on in every company...The work that gets done when no one is watching.\n- And finally, high standards are fun! Once you’ve tasted high standards, there’s no going back.\n\n### **Insist on the Highest Standards**\n\nLeaders have relentlessly high standards—many people may think these standards are unreasonably high. _—from the Amazon Leadership Principles_\n\n_In Summary,_\n\n...the four elements of high standards as we see it: they are teachable, they are domain specific, you must recognize them, and you must explicitly coach realistic scope.\n","id":"06659d74-0326-444e-9ed1-f38b91c1597c"},"42":{"slug":"the-startup-stack","title":"The Startup Stack","shortTitle":"The Startup Stack","description":"","tags":"","heroImage":"","createdAt":"2023-02-06","content":"**Startups:** Where do I even start?\n\n-   The Lean Startup\n    \n\n**Startup Philosophy:** How are startups different from other businesses?\n\n-   Zero to One\n    \n\n**Founder Advice:** What's a founder's life like?\n\n-   Hard Things about Hard Things\n    \n\n**Venture Capital:** How do I raise money?\n\n-   Venture Deals\n    \n\n**Product Development:** How do I turn my ideas into a product?\n\n-   Inspired\n    \n\n**UX Design:** How do I design the product to be easy to use?\n\n-   The Elements of User Experience\n    \n\n**UX Design:** How do I design a product that looks good?\n\n-   Refactoring UI\n    \n\n**Prototyping:** How do I build a prototype of my product?\n\n-   Change by Design\n    \n\n**Analytics:** How do know if my startup is doing well?\n\n-   Lean Analytics\n    \n\n**Marketing:** How do think about marketing an innovative product?\n\n-   Crossing the Chasm\n    \n\n**Customer Development:** How do I test my first prototype?\n\n-   Four steps to the epiphany\n    \n\n**Customer Interviews:** How do I gather feedback from my early customers?\n\n-   The Mom Test\n    \n\n**Go to Market:** How do I take my product to market?\n\n-   Traction\n    \n\n**Understanding Founder Mindset:** How do founders think?\n\n-   Innovators - Isaacson\n    \n\n**Understanding the Valley culture:** What is so different about silicon valley?\n\n-   Chaos Monkeys\n    \n\n**Philosophy of Building:** Should I keep going?\n\n-   The War of Art\n    \n\n**Packaging Ideas:** How do I explain my startup idea to other people?\n\n-   The Art of Explanation\n    \n\n**Storytelling:** How do I tell stories about my startup?\n\n-   Made to Stick\n    \n\n**Blockchain:** WTF is Bitcoin, NFT, Web3, etc?\n\n-   Blockchain Basics\n    \n\n**Marketplaces:** What are platforms/marketplace businesses?

But why?","shortTitle":"We collect links like stamps. But why?","description":"","tags":"","heroImage":"","createdAt":"2022-10-21","content":"Collecting Links is the 21st-century version of collecting stamps. We collect them, organize them, and never use them again.\n\nI think collecting links is even worse - more irrational - than collecting stamps. Stamps have some value. Stamps can be used to send letters. But if left unused or hoarded, this value depreciates over time and soon reaches a point where the value goes so low that stamps become useless.\n\nLike stamps, links have some intrinsic value. This is the value that you get from actually clicking the link and consuming the content of the link. Rationally speaking, you collect a link because you assume that this intrinsic value justifies your collecting and organizing the link.\n\nSo, what happens to the value of a link over time? Like stamps, it depreciates over time. Sometimes sites go out of business, and sometimes the content itself is time-sensitive and becomes useless. After this point, that means the effort that you have put, into collecting the links becomes worthless.\n\nBut Unlike stamps, you don't own the links. This makes link collection far worse than stamp collection. If you own a stamp that has gone out of circulation, there might still be a chance that it becomes a collectible like a painting. There is always a chance, no matter how negligible it is, of hitting a lottery.\n\nWith links, that chance is 0, because you don't own the link. A link might be taken away from you at any time. What you have in your collection is just the address to the content. So collecting links is like collecting addresses to all the famous hotels, hoping that you will one day have the time(money) to go to the hotel.\n\nBut what if you save the content of the link in an app like Pocket? In this case, there is an argument in favor of link collection and it goes like this - in the future, you might find a need for the content and it would be easier for you to access it if you have saved it.\n\nThis might be true but conditionally. You will have to judge the collectability of a link by the following metrics - Probability of finding the link again, Usefulness of the content of the link, and time sensitivity of the content.\n\nFor example:\n\nSaving a link of \"Do things that don't scale\" by PG, might be rational as the content is not time-sensitive, and the usefulness of content is so high that you can't take the risk of missing out, no matter how small that risk is.

If you say that you have knowledge of ‘force’ that just means you are aware of the concept of ‘force’. Similarly, knowledge of ‘freedom’ means you are aware of the concept of ‘freedom’.\n\n_What exactly is a concept?_\n\n> First, let me give you a few more examples of concepts - force is a concept, freedom is a concept, motion is a concept, rational numbers is a concept, a nation is a concept, nazism is a concept, religion is a concept, life is a concept, a forest is a concept, a tree is a concept. \n>\n> Now, the definition of ‘concept’ - A **concept** is a mental grouping of similar objects, events, ideas, or people. \n\n_But, what does it mean?_\n\n> Being aware of the concept of ‘force’ can mean any or all of the following:  \n\n- awareness of people associated with the concept of force like Newton and Faraday\n- awareness of objects associated with the concept of force like falling apples and magnets. \n- awareness of events associated with the concept of force like ‘Newton observing an apple falling from a tree’ or ‘Faraday building his first magnetic machines’.\n- awareness of ideas associated with the concept of force like Laws of Motion, Laws of Gravitation, or Laws of Electromagnetism. \n\n> You can be aware of a concept at different levels. Continuing the example of force, you can be aware of Newton and his ideas on force and motion, without having any clue about his use of calculus and mathematics in those ideas. \n>\n> Now you can think of learning like this - if you have become aware of a concept at a level higher than before, only then you have learned something. Learning happens when you become aware of new concepts - you go from level 0 to level 1 - or when you increase the level of awareness of an old concept - you go from level 1 to level 2 or to level 3. \n\n_If learning is just gaining new knowledge of concepts, then why don’t we just learn from a dictionary or an encyclopedia instead of books? Aren’t those just collections of concepts?_\n\n> Yes, they are collections of concepts. But learning concepts from them is very hard, as you might already know from experience. It's hard because your brain is very inefficient in learning long lists of unconnected concepts. Dictionaries and Encyclopedias are exactly that - long lists of unconnected concepts. \n\n_I thought our brain was smart. Why is our brain inefficient?_\n\n> It is due to the way our memory works. **Memory** is the ability of the brain to store information. We can learn from a dictionary or an encyclopedia but such learning only stays in our memory for a short term, in the long term we forget everything we learned. \n\n_Why does that happen?_\n\n> Think of it like this - in the short term, our memory is limited and it overflows if you give it many concepts to learn. Our brain solves this problem of ‘overflowing **short term memory**’ by forgetting old concepts to make space for new concepts. So, by the time you are learning the tenth word from a dictionary, your brain forgets the first or second to make space for more words. \n>\n> The sad part about all this is that your brain never tells you it has forgotten most of what you tried to learn. You might get an illusion that you have learned all the words but what if you try to retrieve them from memory the next day, you can’t do it. You might recognise the word, know where it was located on the page of the dictionary but you won’t be able to remember it. \n>\n> In summary, when dealing with a lot of concepts that are not connected, your brain remembers them in the short term and forgets them in the long term. \n\n*I understand. This has happened to me a lot, especially when I learn during exams. Now please tell me, how do I remember in the long term?* \n\n> Learning in the long term is just like eating to be healthy. There are a few simple rules that you can follow that greatly improve your health. While eating - eat slowly, give some time for digestion, use the energy and only then eat again. Similarly while learning - learn a few concepts at a time, give them some time to settle down and strengthen, use them to think about the world and only then learn new concepts. If you do this, then you can think of the concepts travelling from the place in our memory which stores concepts in the short term, to a place that stores concepts in the long term. If you learn the right amount of concepts at a time, they transfer from short term memory to **long term memory**. If you learn more than the right amount, the concepts are forgotten. \n\n_But what is the right amount? How do I know when to stop?_\n\n> Some scientists say the number of unconnected concepts that we can learn at one time is under ten.\n\n_Ten? Only ten? What about the days when I have to learn a whole subject before the exam?_\n\n> When I said ten concepts, I specifically said ten ‘unconnected’ concepts. There is a neat trick that we humans have developed to learn a lot more concepts at once. That is ….\n\n_...what is it, tell me, tell me …_\n\n> … … That trick is called **chunking**. We can learn a lot of concepts at once if we pack them together and form chunks. \n\n_What are chunks?_\n\n> **Chunks** are inter-connected packets of concepts. Your brain is lazy at learning lists but it is brilliant at learning chunks. If you form connections between multiple concepts and pack them into chunks, they take much less space in your short term memory in your brain. In other words, your brain stores the chunks much more efficiently than unconnected concepts. This means that you can pack a lot of concepts in very few chunks and then learn all of them at once. \n\n_I understand. Can you give me some examples of chunks and chunking?_\n\n> Sure. Here is an example of chunking \n>\n> Nazism is a concept. Germany is a concept. \n>\n> ‘Nazism in Germany’ is a chunk. \n>\n> ‘Hitler’s Nazism in Germany’ is a bigger chunk.\n>\n> ‘Hitler’s Nazism in Germany during World War 2’ is an even bigger chunk.\n>\n> ‘The Holocaust and Hitler’s Nazism in Germany during World War 2’ is an even bigger chunk. \n>\n> Suppose you have learned the chunk ‘The Holocaust and Hitler’s Nazism in Germany during World War 2’ that means you have learned about the following concepts: Holocaust, Hitler, Nazism, Germany, World War 2.\n>\n> After learning about these concepts, they might exist in your brain at different levels - some might be completely new, others already existing. For example, you may have learned: \n>\n> World War 2 as a series of conflicts between different countries.\n>\n> Germany as a country and its role in World War 2.\n>\n> Hitler as a German politician and a person. \n>\n> Nazism as an ideology and its effects on Jews in Germany.\n>\n> The Holocaust and antisemitism.\n>\n> Overall, you have learned many varied concepts, all at once.\n\n_How is this better than just opening an encyclopedia and learning about these concepts?_\n\n> Okay, imagine learning about all these concepts from an encyclopedia. In order to gain  the same amount of knowledge you have to do the following things:\n\n- Open different chapters in the encyclopedia. \n- Read all the chapters one by one. \n- Keep the concepts from each chapter in your short-term memory. \n- Find a connection between chapters. Again taking space in the short-term memory.\n\n> There are two problems with this method of learning. First, overflow - there are way too many concepts to keep in your short term memory. Second, connection finding - finding connections between two concepts requires an in-depth knowledge of both concepts. When you are learning a concept for the first time, finding connections between them is almost impossible. \n>\n> Chunks solve both these problems. It is because of this reason that most pieces of knowledge meant for human consumption are presented in the form of chunks. An article is a chunk, a chapter is a chunk, a research paper is a chunk, a video is a chunk etc.\n\nI always liked reading stories and comic books. Is a story a chunk? Can we learn from stories?\n\n> Yes, a story is a chunk. Most of the chunks that I mentioned above are stories. Stories are chunks of very high quality. This high quality is due to two reasons - first, you can pack a lot of concepts together into one chunk and second, humans have evolved to process stories much better than any other form of a chunk. \n\n*I was right. From now on, I will find a story chunk of every concept and learn from that.* \n\n> I think that is not a wise thing to do. In your journey of learning, you may come across a lot of good chunks that are not stories - some chapters that not stories, some research papers that are not stories, some articles that are not stories. But learning from these chunks is still better than learning unconnected concepts. \n>\n> A story is a connected series of events - someone always does something, somewhere. When you give a context (circumstances) to a concept, a story is formed.  The context acts as a strong connection between the concepts. However, a chunk can be formed without a context, it just requires a different form of connection.\n>\n> ‘The Miracle Year - How Einstein refuted 200 years of physics in a year’ is a chunk where concepts are connected with a context -  a story chunk. \n>\n> ‘Special Theory of Relativity’ is a chunk where concepts are connected without context - a chunk but not a story. \n>\n> The concepts to be learned from both the chunks are the same - law of invariance (laws of physics are same everywhere) and constant speed of light (speed of light is always constant). \n>\n> On the learning scale \n>\n> **Hardest to Learn** - individual concepts one by one -   law of invariance, constant speed of light\n>\n> **Easier to Learn**\\- simple chunk - ‘Special Theory of Relativity’\n>\n> **Easiest to Learn** - a high-quality chunk, that is a story -  ‘The Miracle Year - How Einstein refuted 200 years of physics in a year’\n\n_I understand. So our mind remembers story chunks better than simple chunks better than unconnected concepts._\n\n> Yes. \n\nAnd then it directly stores these chunks and concepts in memory so that we can use them later. \n\n> No. \n\nOkay… Wait...  What? \n\n> The brain does not store these chunks directly. The brain breaks down chunks into concepts, organises the concepts into categories and then uses these concepts by retrieving them when a new situation arrives. \n\n_That is complicated. Please explain._\n\n> Take an example of a chunk - Nazism and the Holocaust in Germany. If you learn it, your brain will first break it down into concepts. Let us suppose it breaks it down into three concepts - Nazism, Holocaust and Germany. Suppose you learn that \n\n- ‘Nazism’ is a group of ideas that is bad, \n- ‘Holocaust’ is a series of events that led to the killing of Jews, and \n- ‘Germany’ is a group of people living in Europe that call themselves a country. \n\n> Now that your brain has broken the chunk down to concepts, it will categorise them. For example - your brain may store \n\n- ‘Nazism’ as a concept in the category of ‘ideas’, \n- ‘Holocaust’ as a concept in the category of ‘events’, and \n- ‘Germany’ is a concept in the category of ‘countries’. \n\n> Sometime in the future, if you read another chunk - Hitler and Nazism. Your brain does the following things:\n>\n> For Nazism\n\n- It retrieves the knowledge of Nazism that you already have. \n- It reorganizes and restructures the knowledge of Nazism according to the concepts in this new chunk. \n\n> For Hitler\n\n- It adds the concept to the category of bad people.  \n- It tries to find connections between Hitler, Holocaust, and other concepts that exist in your memory. \n\n> Now suppose, one day you come across a person or a leader having a set of ideas that resemble Nazism, you may say that ‘he is a modern nazi’ because his ideas are similar to that of Nazism. \n>\n> Similarly, one day you come across a big factory. You notice that the people in it are kept in tight spaces and are forced to work till they die of weakness. You will retrieve the concept of the holocaust from memory and rebrand the situation as - ‘The Modern Holocaust’. \n>\n> In more formal terms\n\n-  When storing - concepts are chunked so that we can keep them in the short-term memory to understand them and un-chunked so that we can organize them in the long-term memory to store them. \n- When retrieving - depending on the situation we are in, concepts are fetched from long-term memory to short-term memory, where we re-connect them with new knowledge from a situation. \n\n*So wait. We chunk concepts so that the brain understands them. Then the brain undoes all our work by breaking them all down into concepts to store them. Then we re-chunk everything all over again if we want to explain the concepts to others. Isn’t that a lot of work?* \n\n> Yes, it is. But currently, that is just how the human brain does it. It is inefficient but it works and makes us the smartest living thing on earth.\n\n_I wish there was a way in which we could directly store concepts in our brains. That would be much easier, I think. No chunking and un-chunking._\n\n> Theoretically, there is a way to do that. \n\n*How?* \n\n> Think of something like a USB cable that can directly add or update concepts in our brain. If you want to learn, you connect a wire to your brain, upload the concepts and the learning is done. If you want to explain a concept to someone, you send the concept to them through wifi and the explanation is done.\n\nIt sounds amazing. But is it possible?\n\n> It is possible, but it is very hard to do. \n>\n> Our brain is like the genie from Aladdin. We understand what the genie can do, but we have very little idea about how the genie does it. Similarly, we know what our brain can do but we understand very little about how our brain works. \n>\n> We know that the brain has neurons. We also know what these neurons do individually. But we have very little knowledge about how they work together to perform complex tasks. That is a big problem. Storing concepts in the brain requires changing the brain in some way and changing something we don’t understand is not a good idea.\n\n_Oh. I see. So, is there no hope of a cable to the brain?_\n\n> Yes, there is. Human groups can do amazing things. A brilliant man named Elon Musk and his group is trying to build a cable that connects to the brain. It is called neuralink. I will not go into the details, but you can read about it [here](https://waitbutwhy.com/2017/04/neuralink.html). \n\n_But, How…._\n\n… Enough learning about learning. You gained a lot of new knowledge about the concepts related to learning. Now we must stop, or else the concepts will overflow and you might get the illusion of knowledge instead of knowledge. You must give some time to your brain for moving the concepts from short-term memory to long-term memory. A day or two might be enough for that. In the next discussion, when we take up the same topic, you will retrieve most of this knowledge, and only then, we will add new knowledge to it. We will learn more another day. \n\n---\n\nI could have handed you a list of all these terms. But, as we know now, the brain does not work like that. This whole conversation was an example of a chunk of knowledge. \n\nHere is how this chunk is possibly stored in your brain as categorized concepts. \n\n- Learning: gaining new knowledge.\n\n  1.  Knowledge: awareness of or familiarity with concepts.\n\n      - Concept: a mental grouping of similar objects, events, ideas, or people.\n\n- Memory: Memory is the ability of the brain to store information.\n\n  1.  Short term memory\n\n      - Limits of short-term memory\n\n        - Less than 10 concepts\n\n  2.  Long term memory\n\n- Process of Storing Memories\n\n  1.  Encoding memories in short-term memory\n\n      - Chunking: Chunks are groups of related concepts in which your brain can find some meaning. \n\n        - Stories as chunks\n\n  2.  Storage of concepts\n\n      - Consolidation: Moving memories from short-term to long-term memory\n\n        - Breaking down chunks into concepts\n        - Organizing concepts in categories\n\n  3.  Retrieval of Concepts\n\n      - When a situation arrives, we can retrieve memories. \n\n  4.  Forgetting\n\n      - After a certain point, short-term memory is wiped clean.\n\n- People\n\n  - Elon Musk\n\n    - Neuralink\n\n      - USB Cable to store concepts in the brain\n\n---\n\nThis model of how learning and memory work is not perfect, but it is the best model of learning we have currently.\n\nReferences & Inspirations\n\n1.

Growth happens when startups are able to profitably sell a product and then invest the profits back into the startup. For that, startups run experiments to find the right product for the right market. These experiments are just informed trial-and-error-based iterations to find the right product, market, pricing, revenue streams, production procedures, cost, etc.  \n  \n**Layoffs before PMF**  \n  \nA very early-stage startup, one that has just raised a seed round, has 12-24 months to find the Product-Market Fit i.e., the right product for the right market for the right price. To solve this puzzle, these startups run one or two experiments at any given time to find the PMF. If they are successful, they get more money to scale up or they die.  \n  \nIf you have been working at a startup, at this stage, for around 12 months and there are no signs of the PMF, you will probably be laid off, unless you are in the core team of 5-6 people and are willing to work for a pay cut.  \n  \n**What are the signs of PMF?**\n\n  \nMarc Andreessen describes it best - \"The customers are buying the product just as fast as you can make it -- or usage is growing just as fast as you can add more servers. Money from customers is piling up in your company checking account. You're hiring sales and customer support staff as fast as you can.\"  \n  \n**Layoffs after PMF**  \n  \nOnce a startup has found a PMF or is very very certain to find the PMF, they raise more money to grow as fast as possible. They raise funding rounds termed - Series A, B, C, and so on.  \n  \nIn this stage, startups usually use a bi-modal strategy to grow.  \n  \nMode 1: Growth as a result of scaling the initial product by investing in sales and production resources.  \n  \nMode 2: Growth as a result of new products that are invented by running more experiments.  \n  \nMode 1 Layoffs: If you are working on the Mode 1 side of the startup, you will be laid off when the assumptions that worked at a smaller scale start failing on a larger scale. This may happen due to failure to scale up production, and sales, or incorrect assumptions about the size and the paying capacity of the market.  \n  \nMode 2 Layoffs: If you are a part of an experimental product team at a startup, your job is to help get to PMF through experiments. When you have been working for 8-12 months and there is no hope of PMF, you will probably be laid off, unless you are at a leadership level, in which case, you may be given a chance to run one or two more experiments and then laid off if failed.  \n  \n**Heuristic: Growth is usually uncomfortable. If you have been comfortable in your job for the past 6-12 months, you will probably be laid off because there is no growth.**  \n  \nAny thoughts or additions are welcome in the comments.\n","id":"d46f7309-9708-42b8-ae21-1423d478eadd"},"47":{"slug":"write-obvious-and-unoriginal-stuff-014","title":"Write Obvious and Unoriginal Stuff","shortTitle":"Write Obvious and Unoriginal Stuff","description":"","tags":"","heroImage":"","createdAt":"2022-12-23","content":"\nI like writing and want to improve my writing skills.

Or to reword it a bit, how do I write consistently when I don't know enough about the subject that I am supposed to write about? \n\n![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa9aeeca1-5885-4ec0-964b-a6d357facddb_1000x1000.png)\n\nI have been thinking about these questions for a while. And I think I have a good enough solution that I can share.\n\nAnd the solution is to write about obvious and unoriginal stuff.\n\n## Obvious, Unoriginal, yet Useful\n\nIf you go to any website that helps you improve your coding skills, you will probably find a section that asks you to write programs based on mathematical algorithms that you learned in fifth grade. Here is an example of such a section from freeCodeCamp.\n\n![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2466461a-8155-4348-a90c-cedab6529ff1_948x625.png)\n\nTo be clear this practice is not meant for children. There are very few programmers alive who have not written a program on the Fibonacci numbers or a sorting algorithm in their adulthood. These unoriginal and obvious programs are used by programmers to improve their programming skills across ages and languages. Here are the last few programs from the same section on freeCodeCamp.\n\n![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F85831168-0f74-4bd3-9913-c10724f0ac67_1063x713.png)\n\nWhat is so special about this progression? It keeps you consistently interested in the task by providing you with optimal difficulty throughout the task. The progression aims to be never so difficult that you get anxious at any point, and yet never so obvious that you get bored at any point.\n\nInitially, the optimal difficulty is due to the novelty of the programming language, keeping you interested in the practice. The obviousness of the mathematical algorithms is balanced by the difficulty of the programming task due to the lack of programming skills that you possess.\n\nAnd as you progress, and your programming skills increase, the onus of providing the optimal difficulty shifts to mathematical algorithms. Thereby achieving the goal of letting you be interested in the task, the whole way.\n\n## Partially obvious and Wholly unoriginal\n\nNow when a programmer is writing a program that finds the multiples and factors of a number, they are self-aware of it. They know that they are not going to be judged for this program. That the program is obviously, obvious. And anyone who judges their skills for writing such a program is probably not the person they should be paying attention towards.\n\nAlso, this practice makes being unoriginal, acceptable. Through the whole task, you won't probably come up with a solution that hasn't been written before. And this provides a safe space to learn as there is no pressure of standing out by being original.\n\nThe purpose of the task is to churn out lines of code, have moments of self-reflection, find patterns, train your muscle memory, etc. The purpose of the task is neither to be creative nor original, it is to write code and improve your coding skills.\n\n## Write Obvious and Unoriginal stuff\n\nI believe writing can be improved in the same way. By being intentionally obvious and unoriginal.\n\nIf the objective is just to write as much as you can, then to be intentionally obvious and unoriginal is okay, as long as you keep churning out lines of text. You don't have to be as stylish as Stephen King or as original as Adam Smith. You just have to write as much as you can.\n\n![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9a17c139-c384-4eaf-a795-08c2d314512c_1000x1000.png)\n\nWhy write about something philosophical in your first post?

As I said before, _“You form a hypothesis, you design a test, you test the hypothesis, you check for the significance of results and then iterate if you get new data. The new data might refute or support your scientific statement, you accept the results, whatever they may be, and move on”._\n\nWhat we do at startups is use pragmatism, not science. Pragmatism is similar to Science. So similar infact that you may confuse one with the other. Pragmatism, also asks you to consider the evidence, make a decision, and come to a conclusion about the truth. Pragmatism also recommends that you must be willing to change the truth in the light of new evidence, if and when it emerges.\n\nThe difference is that of drawing a line. When it comes to science, the line between truth and non-truth, science and non-science is drawn by general consensus, by what most people in the world believe. The method, the controls, and the settings of the experiment must adhere to those standards of science, or as one may call it - the scientific method. If it does not, whatever you are doing, is not scientific.\n\nCompared to that, pragmatism states that drawing a line, that separates truth from non-truth, is subjective, and is decided by the one conducting the test, by the one making the decision. To be precise, if there is enough data for the result of an experiment to be useful, it is true. What is useful is true.\n\nPragmatism is an approach that works best when we don’t have the time, resources, or tools to conduct science. In the best-case scenario, we would all conduct science, and be absolutely sure about our decisions, about the results of our experiments. But in the real world, we don’t have that luxury. In the real world, there is a deadline, there is a burn rate, there is an expiry date for your business. In those situations, we have to work with what we have, and that is pragmatism.\n\nPragmatism also states that one must be willing to change one’s opinion of the truth or rightness of a decision, based on the new data. It states that all truths are fallible, they are temporary. But they are actionable. Once you have acted on a truth, on some data or evidence, the results will come, and it is your job to adjust your truth based on the results and act more. Again, very similar to science, but not science, pragmatism.\n\nHere are a few examples that differentiate between science and pragmatism, which I generated with the help of GPT.\n\n**Example 1: Launching a new product  \n**  \nPragmatist\n\n-   **Action**: Launches a minimum viable product (MVP) to test the market quickly.\n    \n-   **Reasoning**: Wants immediate feedback and is willing to iterate based on customer responses.\n    \n\nScientist\n\n-   **Action**: Conduct extensive market research and A/B tests of different product features before launching.\n    \n-   **Reasoning**: Seeks to minimize risk and uncertainty through empirical data.\n    \n\n**Example 2: A/B Testing**\n\n-   **Pragmatist**: May conduct A/B tests, but also willing to go to market sooner with less data if it solves an immediate problem.\n    \n-   **Scientist**: Also conducts A/B tests, but typically waits for more comprehensive data before making a decision.\n    \n\n**Example 3: Pricing Strategy**\n\n-   **Pragmatist**: Sets a price that seems reasonable, and adjusts based on early sales data.\n    \n-   **Scientist**: Conducts a detailed price elasticity study before setting the price.\n    \n\nI think is very obvious by this point that terms like lean startup, lean method, data-driven marketing, experiments in startups, etc, are based on pragmatism, not science. It doesn’t matter what people say about them being scientific, they are technically not. And for anyone dwelling in the depths of these domains, this can be confusing.\n\nYou might try to define science in a certain way, to call these approaches scientific. That is an error. You can’t make up a definition of science, that is the whole point of science, being objective, not subjective. If it is not scientific, don’t call it scientific. There is a perfectly good word for it, pragmatic.\n\nOne more thing, pragmatism entails more risk than science. A pragmatic decision has more chances of being wrong than a scientific decision. But that is the cost of action. You can be 95% or maybe even 99% risk-free by being scientific, but you may never act until you get to those percentages. Pragmatism has more variance, your action may in retrospect turn out to be scientific, but it may also turn out to be an utter disaster. The reward is that you keep moving, for better or for worse. It is very obvious from this, why you wouldn’t want to be pragmatic while building a biotech, health-tech, or nuclear
